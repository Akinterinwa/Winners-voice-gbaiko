        body: "Word Foundation For Divine Visitation!\n\"...God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob\" (Gen. 50:24). God's visitation is guaranteed for every believer who has an expectation or hope of a better place than where he or she is presently. No matter the present situation, in your health, finances, career, socially or spiritually, God will surely visit you and take you to your desired place!\n\nHowever, God has a pattern of visitation. And it is important for you to know how God visits His people so that you can keep provoking His visitation in your life from time to time. God's visitation is not something you should encounter just once in a life time, it is designed to be a continuous experience.\n\nHow does God visit His people? Divine visitation draws on divine promises. God will only visit you on the basis of His promises that you know. Your depth of knowledge of His promises is what determines the level of God's performance towards you. In Genesis 21:1 the Bible says, \"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.\" So, the basis for God's visitation is what God has said. If you don't know what He has said, then don't bother expecting His visitation.\n\nThe Lord visited Sarah as He had spoken and what was the proof of that visitation? \"...Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him\" (Genesis 21:2). Sarah was 90 years old and Abraham, an hundred years old, but God's visitation terminated their age-long problem of bareness and it happened at the set time that God had spoken. Concerning that long standing problem in your family, God will visit and intervene for you, but you must know what He has said. Unless you know what God has said, you will be wasting your energy claiming that you are expecting Him to visit you. Only knowledgeable people will keep enjoying the visitation of God.\n\nThe cheapest way for the devil to keep a man in the dark and rob him of God's visitation is to take away knowledge from him. Ignorance remains the tool of the oppressor. Ignorance! Your oppressor does not need to put chains on your hands and feet, all he has to do is to keep away knowledge from you. As long as you are ignorant, you will remain under his charge. But the day you become knowledgeable, you will become free from his chains.\n\nEvery believer who desires to enjoy God's visitation must necessarily be acquainted with His promises. What has the Lord said? If you don't have His promises, you can not experience His visitation because His promises are the reference points for His acts. They are the anchors for His performance. God will never perform beyond His word.\n\nMediate on these: Isaiah 43:26, Numbers 23:19"

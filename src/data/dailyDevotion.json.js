      "body": "Word Foundation For Divine Visitation!\n\"...God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob\" (Gen. 50:24). God's visitation is guaranteed for every believer who has an expectation or hope of a better place than where he or she is presently. No matter the present situation, in your health, finances, career, socially or spiritually, God will surely visit you and take you to your desired place!\n\nHowever, God has a pattern of visitation. And it is important for you to know how God visits His people so that you can keep provoking His visitation in your life from time to time. God's visitation is not something you should encounter just once in a life time, it is designed to be a continuous experience.\n\nHow does God visit His people? Divine visitation draws on divine promises. God will only visit you on the basis of His promises that you know. Your depth of knowledge of His promises is what determines the level of God's performance towards you. In Genesis 21:1 the Bible says, \"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.\" So, the basis for God's visitation is what God has said. If you don't know what He has said, then don't bother expecting His visitation.\n\nThe Lord visited Sarah as He had spoken and what was the proof of that visitation? \"...Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him\" (Genesis 21:2). Sarah was 90 years old and Abraham, an hundred years old, but God's visitation terminated their age-long problem of bareness and it happened at the set time that God had spoken. Concerning that long standing problem in your family, God will visit and intervene for you, but you must know what He has said. Unless you know what God has said, you will be wasting your energy claiming that you are expecting Him to visit you. Only knowledgeable people will keep enjoying the visitation of God.\n\nThe cheapest way for the devil to keep a man in the dark and rob him of God's visitation is to take away knowledge from him. Ignorance remains the tool of the oppressor. Ignorance! Your oppressor does not need to put chains on your hands and feet, all he has to do is to keep away knowledge from you. As long as you are ignorant, you will remain under his charge. But the day you become knowledgeable, you will become free from his chains.\n\nEvery believer who desires to enjoy God's visitation must necessarily be acquainted with His promises. What has the Lord said? If you don't have His promises, you can not experience His visitation because His promises are the reference points for His acts. They are the anchors for His performance. God will never perform beyond His word.\n\nMediate on these: Isaiah 43:26, Numbers 23:19"

  "title": "How To Attract Divine Visitation! (Part 2)",
  "body": "We saw in the previous devotional that divine visitation draws on divine promises. God's word is the pace setter for His visitation. In Numbers 23:19, the Bible says, \"God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?\" God is committed only to what He has spoken and whatever He has said He will make it good. That means He will perform it. If you want any good thing from God, first of all find out what He has spoken. So, if you are not word inclined, you can never attract divine visitation.\n\nEvery time the word of God goes forth, you can be sure that God is on the way coming because He is always attracted towards His word. Permit me to say that God's word is like a remote control to God. Each time you press the word, God is bound to respond, He moves in the direction of His word. Wherever His word goes, there He follows. God is in control of all things but the word controls God.\n\nThe Psalmist said, \"For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name\" (Ps 138:2). So, if you want God to visit your situation and you are just in one corner calling upon His names, \"Oh God of Abraham, Jehovah Rafa, Jehovah Shammah, I need your visitation, come down now!\" You may never get a response to that prayer. But when you begin to put God in remembrance of His word and say to Him, \"Oh my Father, have you not said in Exodus chapter 23 that when I serve you, you would take away sickness from me? Have you not said, you would bless my bread and my water? Over to you Lord, confirm your word in my life. You have spoken it, now make it good!\" Then, you will see God in action.\n\nTalking of the disciples of Jesus, Mark 16:20 says, \"...They went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following.\" God does not consider your age, size or gender to qualify you for His visitation. As long as you are declaring His word in faith, He will show up to confirm it. That is why no matter how long your problem seems to have been, as you keep declaring the word, you are attracting God to yourself for a visitation. He keeps coming closer and closer and closer, and then suddenly, you see Him appear in your situation.\n\nThe deliverance of the children of Israel from bondage as recorded in the book of Exodus was simply a confirmation of the word God spoke to Abraham in Genesis 15:13-14. \"...He said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.\" So, no matter how long a situation lasts, there is always an \"afterward\" because God will never allow Satan to have the final say.\n\nMediate on these: Hosea 14:2, Psalms 89:34"

  "title": "Hope: The Sustainer Of Life! (Hope Part 1)",
  "body": "\"For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion\" (Eccl 9:4). Hope is the foundation for every good thing that will ever come your way in life. There is a common adage that says, \"When there is life, there is hope.\" The only requirement you need to be hopeful is life. As long as you are alive, you have hope; nothing should be strong enough to make you hopeless. It is your hope that determines what God will do for you because that is what inspires your expectation for the fulfillment of His promises towards you. Hope shows you the possibility of achieving what God has said concerning you and then with faith you reach out for it. That is why until hope is in place, faith does not work. Hope sets the goal and faith targets it. So, if you want to hit your target in life, you must be hopeful.\n\nOne major challenge that people face in life is hopelessness. When they make several attempts to breakthrough and there seems to be no way or maybe they have suffered some setbacks, they become so discouraged and begin to wonder, \"Can anything good still come my way? Will I ever make it? How will I overcome all these obstacles on my way?\" The answer is, \"Hope again.\" It doesn't matter what you have lost or how many times you have failed, if you can hope again, a new beginning of success will be created for you in no time.\n\nJob 14:7-9 says, \"For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.\" These were the words of Job; a man who suffered so much calamities in his life. I could imagine him in the midst of all his troubles asking himself, \"If a tree can have hope why shouldn't I have hope?\" And you know, a tree represents life. Even when everything failed, Job said, \"I know that my redeemer liveth\" (Job 19:25). The man was so hopeful that at the end of the day, not only did he survive the terrible afflictions on his body, he got back double of all that he lost.\n\nHope is the sustainer of life. Most people who have given up and committed suicide did so because of hopelessness. They looked around them and felt, \"What else am I living for? There is no way out of this situation. I may as well end it now.\" They lost hope so they lost all, including life. It is the hopelessness of man that makes everything around him to wither and die off (Joel 1:12). Don't cut your life short by losing hope! Even if you are right in the midst of a crisis, tell yourself, \"There is still hope for me!\" Because when one door closes against you, several others are opening up for you, but you need to be hopeful to see them. Don't live your life in regrets, don't stand crying before a closed door, be hopeful and you will find new doors opening to you.\n\nMeditate on these: Romans 4:18-19, Hebrews 11:1"

      "title": "Hope For Your Future! (HOPE PART 2)",
      "body": "Hope is the fountain of every desired future. What enables people to have great dreams for their future and to pursue it, is hope. That is what takes a man from complete failure to total success. Maybe you have looked at your life and you are wondering, \"What have I really achieved?\" It could be that your business, your marriage or career has been dragging for so long and you are feeling very discouraged but I want to say to you, there is hope for you. Whatever is behind you cannot be compared with what is ahead of you, so you can dream again. \n\nAbraham, the Father of faith is also our perfect example in the subject of hope. He waited twenty-five years for his promised-son and all that time, he did not stagger at the promises of God; he never gave up once, rather he remained hopeful. It was in hope that he announced his change of name from Abram -- meaning 'father', to Abraham -- meaning 'father of many nations' even when there was no sign that he would have a child (Genesis 17:5). Apart from the fact that Sarah his wife was barren and past childbearing age, Abraham himself was very old. So, medically and physiologically speaking, theirs was a 'hopeless' case, but the Bible tells us that Abraham believed in hope against all natural hope (Romans 4:18-19). And because \"Hope maketh not ashamed...\" his shame was turned into glory. If only you will remain hopeful, every shame around your life will soon be replaced with glory! \n\nSarah said in her testimony, \"...Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age\" (Genesis 21:6). That means it was naturally impossible; it looked as if it would never happen but because hope was in place, it came to pass.\n\nI don't know what your present situation is, probably your pocket is empty, your clothes are worn out, or you are squatting in somebody's house with no means of getting your own in the nearest future, no matter how bad it looks, there is still hope for you! When nothing seems to hold any longer, if you can grab the anchor of hope and hold unto it, your future will be secured. \n\nSatan is good at moving people to be angry with themselves so that they not only lose hope but also close their cases by themselves. People may even look at you and say, \"What can he become?\" The only thing that will keep you going at such times is the hope that you have in the future that is set before you. You must be determined not to give up on yourself. When everything seems to be lost there is nothing else to hold in terms of human support, resources or position, don't lose hope. Even when you try so hard and can't catch anything, catch hope! You know why you must remain hopeful? You are still under construction; God is still working on you, so it is too early to judge or conclude your case. The real you is just about to emerge. Be hopeful!\n\nMeditate on these: Hebrews 13:2, Phil. 3:14"

      "title": "Hope For Help! (HOPE PART 3)",
      "body": "God can do all things but He cannot help the hopeless. God is moved to act on your behalf only as long as your hope is alive! I remember some time ago I had the opportunity of praying for a young man who was sick and in hospital. As I spoke with him he said, \"Truly pastor, I am afraid I will die.\" And despite the prayers and all that was done to help him, he died because he had lost hope. Meanwhile there are other people who have been afflicted with more deadly diseases than that young man and they were healed with less support. They were so hopeful that God had no choice but to heal them.\n\nNo matter how fiery the messages of faith that a man hears, if he is hopeless he remains helpless. The greatest bondage satan can put a man in, is that of hopelessness because it cuts off his access to divine help.\n\nDavid the Psalmist said, \"I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Therefore...my flesh also shall rest in hope.\" When you choose to keep your heart focused on God, you cannot be moved by circumstances. He also said, \"For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption\" (Psalms 16:8-10). No matter how deep the pit you have fallen into, God will not leave you there! He will not allow you to see corruption as long as you maintain your hope in Him. It is your hope that attracts God's help.\n\nSometimes, in a bid to push you into hopelessness, satan will tell you, \"Stop bothering yourself. Count the number of times you have tried and failed. Forget it! There is just no way out!\" But a hopeful man does not count his failures, he counts his opportunities. The more you count the number of times you have been disappointed the more disappointed you become. A hopeful man says, \"I don't care how many times I have tried and failed in the past, this time I will make it!\"\n\nLife is full of challenges, everyday you hear people expressing hopelessness as a result of failing economy, joblessness and all manner of things. But the truth is, in the midst of hopelessness, you can still be hopeful because hopelessness is not a function of what happened to you, but a function of your attitude to what happened. You have to learn to do what David did in Psalm 42. Anytime you notice that hopelessness is about to settle with you, speak to you heart, \"Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance\" (Psalms 42:5). Fight hopelessness with everything in your power because it's aim is to render you helpless. Even if you have been told by doctors that there is no cure for that ailment in your body, consider it as an expression of their own limitations. God has no limitations. He is older than medicine and all things are possible with Him, so keep your hope alive! Remain continuously hopeful in God in order to enjoy His help continuously.\n\nMeditate on these: Job 11:18, Psalm 130:7"

      "title": "You Can Stir Up Your Hope! (HOPE Part 4)",
      "body": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope...\" (1 Peter 1:3). Basically, every believer has a deposit of hope in his heart. So, when hopelessness attempts to take root in your heart, you can counter it. You can stir up your hope by taking the following steps: Keep Looking Ahead: In Hebrew 12:2 the Bible talking of Jesus says, \"...Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\" Jesus came to terminate hopelessness in our lives and to show us how to remain hopeful in all circumstances of life. He came to show us how to look ahead so that we can keep moving ahead. Even while He was being crucified on the cross, He was hopeful. He knew that the cross was not His end. And because His eyes were fixed on the joy and the glory that was set before Him, He was able to endure and go through the pressures of crucifixion. That is the same approach you must give to life, no matter what has happened or is happening around you, keep looking ahead because your tomorrow is brighter than your today.\n\nLet The Past Pass: If you want to remain hopeful, you must free yourself from the past; regard the past as past and refuse to look backward. Many people depress and stagnate themselves by casting their minds back to what they call \"the good old days.\" But the Bible says in Ecclesiastes 7:10, \"Do not say, Why were the old days better than these? For it is not wise...\" (Amp.) Just as you need to erase negative experiences of the past from your mind, you also need to forget \"the good old days.\" As the name rightly implies, they are 'old days', and what is old cannot be relevant to the now! Of course, you can pick lessons from your past to enhance your present position and prepare yourself for the future, but never settle down with the past, no matter how good or bad it was. Hope for something new. Let the past pass so that you can move forward into your next phase in life.\n\nBe Conscious Of God's Presence: The psalmist said, \"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.\" (Psalms 23:4). When you are conscious of God's presence you become immovable. Has He not promised that He would go before you to make the crooked places straight (Isaiah 45:2)? He said He will bless you in your going out and in your coming in, in the city and in the field (Deuteronomy 28:3, 6). The fact that you have a little setback now does not mean that God has left you, He is with you in every place and at all times. And if God be for you who can be against you? Your awareness of God's presence will continually stir up your hope, because then you will be assured that He is making a way of escape for you out of that challenge.\n\nMeditate on these: Matt. 28:20, Luke 9:62"

      "title": "How To Keep Your Hope Alive! (HOPE Part 5)",
      "body": "As a Christian, you are a creature in the class of God and because God is never hopeless, you also have what it takes to keep your hope alive always, no matter what is happening around you.\n\nThere are two groups of people you must beware of in order to keep your hope alive and strong; they are sympathizers and scorners! You may have noticed that when a child falls down and nobody makes a comment, he gets back on his feet and continues playing. But if somebody screams and rushes to help him up, that is when he begins to cry, in reaction to the sympathy, not the fall. If you have had a fall and you want to rise up again in life, don't let anybody sympathize with you, don't even talk like a man who needs sympathy or pity and don't pity yourself. Rather, start looking forward to the time you will share your testimony, because that situation will surely turn to you for a testimony (Luke 21:13). \n\nAnother thing about sympathizers is that they tend to think for you, they offer all manner of suggestions and make so many promises which they may never keep, all because they see you as an object of concern. The truth is, when you are in a tight corner, that is the time to think for yourself, because it is only what you get for yourself that will last with you. Instead of looking for who will sympathize with you or pity you, seek the counsel of experienced and matured people who will stir up your hope and motivate you to start taking steps forward.\n\nThe second group of people that would always seek to break your heart are scorners. But you must learn to despise them. Ignore those who laugh at you as though they are non-existent. Pay no attention to them because they are only out to distract you. When Jesus was being crucified, the people scorned Him. Some said, \"If you are the son of God, come down from the cross.\" They put a crown of thorns on His head and mockingly called Him \"the King of the Jews.\" Yet His eyes were fixed on the crown ahead and now He is seated in glory. \n\nNo matter what you are doing in life, there will always be scorners who will look at you and say, \"What do you think you can become? Who do you think you are?\" This was the attitude of Sanballat and Tobiah towards Nehemiah and the people of God when they were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. They laughed them to scorn and despised them. But Nehemiah's response was, \"...The God of heaven will prosper us ...\" (Nehemiah 2:19-20). It was a seemingly impossible task, but as the Israelites kept at it and refused to be distracted, the work was completed in record time.\n\nThose who regard themselves as pillars or experts in your field of endeavour may laugh at your little beginning, but refuse to be intimidated! Rather, be confident of the fact that though your beginning is small your later end shall greatly increase (Job 8:7).\n\nMeditate on these: Psalm 27:3-4, Philippians 1:6"

      "title": "If You Are Thankful You Will Be Hopeful! (HOPE Part 6)",
      "body": "Hope is the sustainer of life. Those who lose hope ultimately lose their lives. If you lose anything in life, never lose hope. And one of the ways to remain hopeful is to be thankful; have a sense of appreciation.\n\nWhen people begin to feel that they are not making progress in life as expected, their hope naturally begins to dwindle. But if you check very well, you will discover that you have made some progress, your life generally has appreciated in some ways, no matter how small. The reason many people look dejected and unfulfilled is because they lack sense of appreciation. They always see what is not working, what has failed and what has not happened. Some even go as far as raining condemnation upon themselves, \"I am not good, I am not smart, I can't make it, I am finished!\" And that is how they withdraw goodwill from themselves. Even when other opportunities come their way, they miss it, because they have lost faith in themselves. \n\nPlease look around your life carefully, check your records and you will discover that something has been added to you. If you can't see any increase in your business, check your family, check other areas and you will discover that things are not the way they used to be. Don't take any act of God in your life for granted, never slight His blessings! The fact that you are alive is enough to make you have hope for a better tomorrow!\n\nYou are complaining because you have only seen little increase in your business. Have you forgotten that it is small plus small that becomes big? Every addition to your life, no matter how little, is a good starting point for greatness. Do you know that the same things that some people threw away for lack of appreciation, are the things that others have picked up and used to become great in life?\n\nIt is your appreciation over little that makes it appreciate into much. When you appreciate God for one, He will multiply it to ten or even thousands, because He knows what you will do next. \n\nOften times, satan draws your attention to something that seems not be working or progressing in your life, in a bid to depress you; to make you believe that there is no hope for you in that area. That is when you should start thanking God for the privilege of life, thank Him for everything around you and you will discover that there is a new surge of hope in your heart. Suddenly, something will begin to tell you, \"If you have come this far, you can go one more step further.\" You can't be thankful and remain hopeless. No! A thankful heart is always a hopeful heart. So, be excited with your life!\n\nMeditate on these: Psalm 67:5-7, Malachi 2:1-2"

      "title": "The Source Of Hope! (HOPE Part 7)",
      "body": "Hope is a scarce commodity in our world today. Every where you turn, you hear of wars, famine, epidemics, unemployment and other calamities that have left many people fearful and hopeless in life. That is why God gave us His Word. The Holy Bible is the principal source of hope. It points to you what you can become rather than showing you your present position. It inspires you to see a future rather than explaining to you the circumstances. The Bible is the only book that shows you how a prisoner could become a prime minister over night. It literally beckons you into a bright and great future by showing you God's plan for your life. He said in Jeremiah 29:11, \"For I know the plans that I have for you...plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope\" (NASV).\n\nIt is information that keeps hope alive and that is what God's Word does for you. It helps you to look up from where you are to where you ought to be. That is why it says to a sick person for instance, \"Let the weak say, I am strong\" (Joel 3:10). In other words, the weak is not expected to die in his weakness, there is hope that he will soon be strong again so let him start declaring it. To the poor the Bible says, \"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory...\" (1 Samuel 2:8). It says in Job 22:24, \"Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.\" No matter how poor a man is, these words will inject him with hope for lasting and stress-free prosperity. So, when you see such a person jumping and rejoicing while others may be pitying him, it is because he has seen something from God's word, which will soon come pass for him.\n\nThe Psalmist said, \"My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word\" (Ps 119:81). Haven't you noticed also, that whenever you are downcast and you come to Church where you hear the Word of God, hope is rekindled in your heart? In the place of depression you return home with joy. Every word of God inspires hope, so to be Wordless is to be hopeless. Even when you are knocked down and your situation looks hopeless, if you can just muster up your last energy and open the Bible to read, God will show you a scripture that will fire up your hope again and in no time you will be back on your feet. \n\nThe strength of your faith is a function of the strength of your hope. But the strength of your hope is determined by how much of the Word you have. Those who have the Word never easily become hopeless in life. When the Word of God imparts hope to you it gives you vision. That is, it shows you pictures of the colourful future that you have in Christ. And when you see a future you cannot be cast down.\n\nMeditate on these: Jeremiah 15:16, Psalm 119: 49,62"

      "body": "Hope is a vital force that is generated in the heart of man to affect all areas of his life positively. Even though hope is born in the heart, it is expressed through your countenance and your words. When you are hopeful, you will be joyful. Joy is the sure sign of hope, while depression is the sign of hopelessness. When joy keeps bursting forth in your soul as a result of the picture that you have seen of your future, it is an indication that hope is present. But when you notice depression around you, it means hopelessness is trying to arrest you, and you should free yourself immediately by taking steps to stir up your hope. \n\nTalking of Jesus in Hebrews 12:2 the Bible says, \"...Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\" That is what hope does. It shows you the joy that is set in your future so that you can begin to rejoice in the now. It is that joy that energizes you to disregard and despise the contrary circumstances on your way and helps you to maintain focus till you arrive the throne.\n\nSo, your joy is not circumstance determined, it is hope determined. That is why even in the midst of hardship, if you are hopeful nothing can tamper with your joy because hope tells you, \"Your situation will not always be like this. Things will soon change for the better.\" It reminds you that the end of a matter is better than the beginning thereof, and that everything is working together for your good (Rom 8:28, Eccl. 8:7).\n\nAnother way you know a hopeful man is through his utterances. A hopeless man would say, \"It is finished, there is no way out.\" But a hopeful man will always say, \"I can still make it, my case cannot be closed yet.\" Your situation may not look it, but keep speaking words of hope to yourself because the more you do that, the more hopeful you become. When you tell yourself, \"I can make it\" you begin to receive the strength to make it. You know why you must keep speaking words of hope to yourself? If you don't speak, satan will speak to you. Never you wake up in the morning and sit at the edge of your bed with your hand on your chin. That is an invitation to satan to speak words of hopelessness to your heart. He will tell you, \"Can you see yourself now? You failed yesterday and it is obvious that you will fail again today.\" But as soon as you wake up, jump out of the bed and begin to speak covenant words into your day, \"This is the day that the Lord has made, I will rejoice and be glad in it! I am going forward today! My path is shinning brighter today! God will prosper me today!\" When satan tells you, \"You will never make it\", tell him, \"Nothing can stop me because God is on my side!\" The Bible says, \"Hope maketh not ashamed...\"(Rom. 5:5). As you keep expressing your hope, you will never be put to shame! The word of God shall be confirmed in your life!\n\nMeditate on these: Romans 15:13, Numbers 14:28"

      "body": "Our world is full of diverse evils; robberies, ritual killings, assassinations, accidents, spread of killer diseases, pestilence, etc. The hearts of men are beginning to fail them for fear, unfortunately, including Christians. This is why you must know how to exercise dominion over fear so as to escape the evils of the day.\n\nThe Bible says, \"The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe\" (proverbs 29:25). Fear is a snare, it is a trap that holds people down and often opens the door to all manner of calamities. Fear is the strongest weapon in the hand of the enemy because he knows that what you fear today will happen tomorrow, just as what you believe today will certainly come to pass for you tomorrow. There is an account in the Bible of a man called Job, he suffered so much calamities to the extent that his life was almost cut short if not that God had warned satan not to go that far. In his testimony Job said, \"For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came\" (Job 3:25-26). Satan would not have had any power over Job if he did not fear. That means the things you don't fear will never come upon you.\n\nIn the study of wildlife we are told that before a lion attacks its prey, it roars to intimidate the prey and to charge up himself. Similarly, before satan attacks you, he first of all sends fear into your heart to intimidate you and to seek your permission to carry out his threat. It is when you open up to him that he has the chance to oppress you. For instance he tells you, \"You will not return from this journey, you will die in an accident\", etc. But the truth is, if Satan has the power to kill you, he won't need to tell you before hand. That is why I Peter 5:8 says, \"...your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour...\" Please take note of the highlighted words. Satan only goes about as a lion, he is not really a lion. There is only one true Lion and that is Jesus; the Lion of the tribe of Judah, who is also your Lord and your saviour. Secondly, satan goes about seeking whom he may devour. That connotes probability. He does not have the power to devour everybody! He can't just jump on you, he requires your permission to oppress you, and he gets it when you respond to his threats through fear.\n\nFear has a distorting effect on the human heart, that is why when a man is afraid, the heart beat increases. And in some extreme cases, people have died suddenly out of fear. This is why you must refuse Satan's suggestions every time he tries to intimidate you. Don't allow fear to take root in your heart! As soon as satan sends a signal of fear to you, kill it with the word of God. Guard your heart diligently against fear and you will never be a victim! \n\nMeditate on these: Proverbs 4:23, Philippians 1:28"

      "title": "How To Kill Fear! (FEAR Part 2)",
      "body": "Fear is one of satan's strategies to disarm the saint and make him a cheap prey. He flashes all kinds of dangerous images into your mind and when you become afraid, he afflicts you. No matter how righteous you are if you fear you will fall. Psalm 91:5 says, \"Thou shall not be afraid...\" That means it is in your power to say 'no' to fear or to open the door to it. Philippians 1:28 says, \"And in nothing terrified by your adversaries...\" Your defence in God is impenetrable; there is a hedge of protection around you that satan cannot cross but his plan is to terrify you, he wants to scare you and make you forsake your defence, so that he can afflict and devour but you can stop him. \n\nThe truth is, fear comes to all; there is no man who does not fear. David, a great warrior who never lost a single battle in his life said in one of his prayers to God, \"What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee\" (Psalm 56:3). So, fear comes to all, but your reaction determines your outcome. You don't overcome fear with prayer, rather you kill it by talking faith. When satan threatens you, don't keep quite! Speak out in faith! It may be insignificant to you, but the sound of your voice as you declare the word of God, has great impact in the spirit realm. When you make declarations of faith, satan begins to take steps backwards and to withdraw his demons out of their hiding places.\n\nSo, anytime he brings the fear of death to your heart, declare boldly, \"I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord\" (Psalms 118:17). He tells you, \"You will have an accident today.\" Declare with all your might, \"God has given His angels charge over me, they bear me up on their wings lest I dash my foot against a stone. I cannot have accident!\" Whatever you talk against, can't have power over you. So talk courageously against every threat of evil that satan brings into your heart, keep declaring your faith in the covenant of exemption that you have in Christ. \"I am defended! I am kept by the power of God! No plague shall come near my dwelling! A thousand may fall at my right hand and ten thousand at my left hand, it shall not come near me! I cannot suffer lack and want!\" You can't be speaking and be afraid at the same time.\n\nOne of the secrets of very courageous and bold men is speaking. They intimidate their oppositions with their words. That was how David killed Goliath. Goliath cursed David in the name of his gods but David did not keep quiet. I can imagine him declaring with all his might, \"This day will the LORD deliver you into my hand; and I will take your head from you...that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel\" (1 Sam 17:46). And as he used his sling, by a strange force, the little stone penetrated into the skull of Goliath and he fell down dead. You know why? David had killed him with his declarations of faith before the stone touched his head. So, when you speak out in faith, you are destroying your fears and at the same time disarming your enemy. The more you speak the more courageous you become. That is why when soldiers go to war they sing all manner of instigating songs, to kill fear from their hearts. If you don't know how to speak you will become a cheap prey in the hands of the enemy because death and life are in the power of the tongue (Prov.18: 21). God said in Isaiah 54:17, \"No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper...\" Why? Because He expects you to speak out and condemn every tongue that rises up against you in judgment.\n\nMeditate on these: Psalm 81:10, 91:2"

      "title": "Guard Your Heart Against Fear! (FEAR Part 3)",
      "body": "The Bible says in 2 Timothy 1:7, \"God has not given unto us the spirit of fear...\" So, fear is a spirit and it is not from God, it is from the devil, and his target is your heart not your head. That is why you must guard your heart with all diligence. Jesus said, \"These signs shall follow them that believe, in my name shall they cast out devils...\" including the evil spirit of fear. So, when fear comes knocking on the door of your heart, you cast it out in the name of Jesus! Better still, you can stop fear from gaining access to your heart. \n\nOne of the avenues by which fear gains access to the heart is through what we see and what we hear. Many people become afraid when they hear of the evil that has happened to other people. When they hear that somebody has died of cancer they begin to ask, \"Who can be saved?\" But the Bible says, \"A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.\" (Psalms 91:7). God has exempted you from whatever evil is happening around your vicinity or around the world. So when you see people dying, and diverse diseases spreading all over the place or you hear gunshots at night, don't fear because you are not their target. What that scripture means is that eleven thousand people must first be destroyed before the trouble can come near you. The worst satan is permitted to do is to come near, he is not permitted to touch you. The things you regard are the things you fear, if at the instances of hearing evil news, you are smart enough to say, \"No! It can't happen to me\", you have escape fear already.\n\nThe Bible says, \"...Take heed what ye hear...\" (Mark 4:24) and \"Take heed therefore how ye hear...\" (Luke 8:18). Relationship influences -- negatively or positively, so mind who you listen to! Never call a man your friend who does not edify you with his words. Don't let people feed fear into you, don't stay around talebearers. Keep company with people who carry good news, people who will always assure you that your life and future are preserved in God. Walk with people who have focus and who plan great things for the future, not people who speak with uncertainty and who talk of writing a will when they have not achieved anything in life. It may be the accepted norm in the society for a man to write his will when he is fifty years of age, but it is not scriptural because such things signal death to come. The implication of writing a will is that the man is expecting to die soon. If you are not expecting to die yet never think of writing a will! \n\nOften times, when satan can't get your attention with words from people, he comes to show you some fearful things in your dream. And an ignorant believer would wake up in the morning after having such bad dreams and begin to announce it to everyone he meets, thereby confirming what the devil has shown him. When satan comes to show you anything that is contrary to the Word of God or contrary to your desire, as soon as you wake up, cancel it and decree what you want instead. Cast down that imagination according to 2 Corinthians 10:4-5. \"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ...\"\n\nAlso, take heed what you read. Whatever is not backed up with Truth from scriptures, drop it, it is not your portion! Don't let tradition or the sayings of the elders kill you before your time. Many of such things are fables, they have no biblical basis. I don't care who is saying anything, if it is not founded in scriptures, it is not the Truth and if it is not the truth it is not for me! Go for the Truth and clear the enemy out of your way. Walk in the liberty wherein Christ has made you free!\n\nMeditate on these: Prov. 4:23, Isaiah 54:14, 1 Peter 1:13"

      "body": "Most of the afflictions and evils that happen to men come as a result of their fears but I have good news for you -- you don't have to fear! No matter the evils and calamities in the world today, you are too covered to be uncovered! Colossians 3:3 says, \"...your life is hid with Christ in God.\" Except you step out of the stronghold by yourself, through fear, you are far from satan's reach. He would have to touch God before he can touch you. That is why the Bible says, \"...For he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye\" (Zechariah 2:8). You are too defended to be offended! You are totally protected!\n\nYou don't have to fear epidemics, accidents, sudden calamities, etc. You know why? God is with you. \"...For he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear...\" (Hebrews 13:5-6). The reason many Christians are fearful is simply because they are not conscious of God's presence with them. David said, \"...Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me\" (Psalm 23:4). He was too conscious of God's presence, no wonder he could not be killed by any of his enemies.\n\nGod is not only with you He is also watching over you. Psalm 121:4 says, \"Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.\" The reason God does not sleep is so that He can keep you. He keeps awake in order to keep your enemy away. So, you can afford to sleep soundly at night like a proper child of God, instead of curling up on one edge of your bed as if you rented it. Relax, your keeper is awake!\n\nAnother reason why you don't have to fear is because God's word says, \"There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling\" (Psalm 91:10). That is not only a promise, it is also a decree. There is a hedge; a boundary around you that satan is not permitted to cross. Please, don't leave your life to chance, don't join those who say, \"Whatever happens, whether accident, sickness or death, it is the will of God.\" That is a lie from hell! It is satan's device to make people hold God responsible for everything that happens around them while he keeps causing havoc and goes unnoticed. Will you as a parent organize accident for your child? Or will you give your precious daughter a deadly disease just to teach her a lesson? If you, being a natural man would not do that, why do you think God will push you into danger? No man's experience is superior to the word of God. He has said, \"No evil shall come near your dwelling.\" It's up to you to believe it and refuse to fear.\n\nPaul the Apostle said, \"...For I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him...\" (2 Timothy 1:12). No body can keep your life better than God because He gave it to you in the first place. So, commit your life and all that you have to God and trust Him to keep you because He is able.\n\nMeditate on these: Numbers 6:24, Psalm 91:1"

      "title": "Walking In Love!",
      "body": "Every commandment in the Bible can be summarized in one word: love. When Jesus was asked in Matthew 22: 37-39, \"Which is the greatest commandment?\" He said, \".... Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. And...Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\" If you look at all the other commandments like, \"Thou shall not bear false witness, thou shall not covet thy naigbhours goods nor his wife, thou shall honour thy father and thy mother\", you will discover that they all take their root in love. If you love your neghbour you won't go after his or her spouse, neither will you corner his goods or dupe him in business. The neighbour you love, you won't backbite or speak evil of. If you love your father and your mother you will not need any encouragement to honour them.? That is why the Bible says, \"Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law\" (Romans 13:8). So, until you begin to walk in love, you are yet to start the race of Christianity. \"...For love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love\" (1 John 4:7-8).\n\nLove is a seed, which when sown yields a harvest of love, because whatsoever a man sows is what he will reap. Love does not just happen, someone has to take the initiative. 1 John 4:7 says, \"Beloved, let us love one another...\" The word, 'let' connotes that it is an act of your will or initiative, not a feeling. If you wait for your feelings, you will never walk in love because often times, the people you are required to love, by your personal assessment, may not be deserving of it. They may have offended you and done all manner of things against you, but because love is a commandment, it is not optional, you don't wait to feel like it, you must walk in love in order to please God.?\n\nLove has many definitions to many people, but let me show you the biblical definition of love.\n\nLove Is Sacrificial\n\nI believe that due to lack of adequate words, the English dictionary defines love as a deep emotion, but the biblical definition of love entails sacrifice. It says in John 3:16, \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" The true meaning of love is giving, not just giving but giving sacrificially. Love is always willing to sacrifice. Love will make you willing to go an extra mile in order to redeem and rescue a neighbor in need. Love breeds togetherness, because it is always accommodating. Where there is love, people give freely, every one is a contributors, no one parasites on the other.\n\nLove is so important to God that He said, \"...He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?\" (1 John 4:20). The only way to prove your love for God is to show your love for people. Until God sees your love for your neighbour, don't claim to love Him.\n\nMeditate on these: 1 Corinthians 13:4, Matthew 6:15"

      "title": "What Is Love?",
      "body": "Christianity is all about love. God called us and saved us, not because we deserve it but because of His great love for us. And we are in turn commanded to love others in the same unconditional way. So, as a believer, you re called to walk in love. In the previous devotional, we began to look at the biblical definitions of love. Here, I want show you two more definitions. \n\nForgiveness\n\nIn addition to sacrificial giving, love also entails being able to forgive others. The word, 'forgive' is a compound word meaning to fore-give, that is giving in advance. I love the way Bishop Oyedepo puts it, he said, \"Before people offend me, I have forgiven them. So their offences only come to meet my forgiveness.\" That is how to live. Ephesians 4:32 says, \"And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.\" If you are always capitalizing on faults you will be frustrated because there are some people who will never apologize when they offend you. As a matter of fact, they are happy that you are hurt. And once Satan senses this weakness in you, he will ensure that people keep offending and hurting you, so as to destabilize your spiritual life. But if you are filled with love you will always forgive your offenders and by so doing you maintain an unbroken relationship with God.\n\nService\n\nOne other nature of love is service. True love will serve others. It is very unfortunate that in our societies today, many seek for significance in the place of relevance. They want to feel important rather than prove their relevance through service. When Jesus was on earth, He displayed love through service. He was relevant to the people by meeting their diverse needs; He healed the sick, fed the poor, etc. He was always moved by the needs of the people. Let love move you to become relevant in your family and in every place you are found. Seek to serve others as a proof of your love. One of the reasons God has blessed you is so that you can be a blessing to others by serving them with your means.\n\nSee What Love Will Do For You\n\nThe major benefit of walking in love is divine presence. God is Love so His presence will always be with those who walk in love. Ephesians 4:30-31 says, \"And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice.\" Malice, bitterness, anger and evil speaking grieve the Spirit of God, and once the Holy Spirit is grieved, God's presence cannot be there. When you lack God's presence, the hedge becomes broken and the serpent begins to bite. This is the root of most business and family crisis, sicknesses and loses that people suffer. When you live in strife with people around you, nothing moves for you. You just keep labouring and sweating yet nothing works because the goodwill that should makes things work is lacking. As much as lies within your power, walk in love, follow peace with all men. Don't drive away God's presence from your life with anger and malice! Give Him His rightful place and no devil can have access to devour you or yours. Be blessed today!\n\nMeditate on these: James 3:16, 1 John 3:17-18"

      "title": "Initiating Good Relationships!",
      "body": "Life is all about friendship and relationships. That is why the Bible says, \"A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly...\" (Proverbs 18:24). That means, if you want people to relate well with you, you have to initiate it. People will always give back to you what you give to them; they will relate with you the way you relate with them. A wife who desires a good relationship with her husband for instance must initiate it by being a proper wife. Likewise a husband who desires a good relationship with his wife must show himself to be a loving and caring husband. A man that wants his co-workers to relate well with him must be a good colleague to them. So, before you conclude that people don't like you, you need to ask yourself, \"Do I like people?\" Before you claim that people detest you, check yourself, don't you also detest them? If you say your wife is difficult, are you not also a difficult husband? Don't sit down and wait for people to relate well with you, you have to take the first step to relate well with them. Even if you live among strangers, you can still be loved if you initiate good relationship with them. God desires good relationship with man so He initiated it by doing to us what He wants us to do to Him. He first loved us, before He demanded for our love. He gave to us first before He commanded us to give. So, if you discover that people don't relate well with you, all you need to do is examine yourself and change your attitude towards them. \n\nInvest In Relationships! \n\nRelationship is all about investment. We want to enjoy many things in life but we hardly want to give out anything. We want people to love us but we find it difficult to show love to them. Until you give, you can't receive. I discovered a golden rule that has become one of my guiding principles in life: whatever you want to see happen for yourself, make it happen for others. The reason we encounter problems in relating with other people is because we often expect more from them than we are ready to give to them. Jesus said, \"...All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets\"(Matthew 7:12). He means to say that this principle is the summary of the law and all that the prophets have said in the Bible. If you are able to obey this commandment you have fulfilled all the requirements of the law. Whatever you expect from people, give it to them. What you don't expect, don't give to anybody. For instance, if you want to have a harmonious marriage, simply give to your spouse what you expect from him or her. \n\nThe Bible says in Proverbs 26:27, \"Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.\" That means whatever you give to others will automatically come back to you. So, whatever you detest never present to others; what you won't take, don't give to others. If you don't want your home to be destroyed, don't be a part of destroying other people's homes. Before you do anything to somebody, sit back and think, \"If this is done to me how will I feel?\" If you want others to respect you, respect them. \n\nMeditate on these: Galatians 6:7, Genesis 8:20"

Leave your troubles behind, open your heart to the Lord, and enter into His gates with thanksgiving.\n\nHowever, this is not because all your requests are granted but because your name is written in the Book of Life and this cannot be exchanged for anything. Any other prayer should be secondary to thanksgiving and praises.\n\nSecret #2\n\nConfirm God's Will\n\nFind out whether what you are asking for is God's will for your life. You do not go to God asking whether to divorce your spouse and marry another. Of course that is NOT God's will for your life and He is not going to answer.\n\nSecret #3\n\nIdentify Your Needs and be Specific\n\nHere's where many people fall down. What some are looking for may not be what they need.\n\nLike many people who say they want to be very rich (materially), promising to sponsor the work of the gospel to any level. As far as God is concerned, that person may not need to be rich at all. Maybe all God wants to do is to turn her life upside down and drain all the impurities (like bitterness, unforgiveness, etc) out of her life to make her more useful. But she just wants to be rich!\n\nAnother might want to prophesy and see visions, but God might just want her to deal with the spirit of anger first. Because with this spirit inside her, she will destroy every good thing that God sends her way.\n\nYet another might be praying for a godly spouse, but all God wants the person to do is to go for a thorough deliverance FIRST to drain out all the evil deposits that the enemy has injected into her life through sex in the dream. Because He knows that if He allows her to marry in this state, divorce is just a few years down the road!\n\nSecret #4\n\nMeditate on Scripture\n\nThis is the biggie...\n\nIdentify scriptures that promise what you need and meditate on them. As you meditate on a particular scripture, a powerful image will begin to form in your mind. As the image settles in your thoughts, it will be out-pictured (through focused praying) into the physical world around you...\n\nOne thing we will be doing during the upcoming Prayer Academy is to pray \"one-pointed\" prayers with that image in the mind... in order for them to manifest quickly.\n\nBy the way, there are 7,487 solid promises in the Bible.\n\nSecret #5\n\nPray with an Expectant Heart and with Faith\n\nThis is bold, confident praying that expects to receive answers. In spite of any physical evidence to the contrary. You can read all about faith in the New Testament book of Hebrews chapter 11.\n\nSecret #6\n\nOrganize Your Presentation Before God\n\nIf you've read my ebook, \"Prayer DNA Secrets\" you would have come across what I call \"vagabond praying.\" It is asking for too many things or praying about different issues... all in one breadth. This is a total waste of time.\n\nGod expects us to take the time to ask for one thing AT A TIME. Your prayer must be focused. This means you take up a prayer point and pray it to a level of assurance before moving to the next one. In fact as you pray, you will begin to feel the assurance of answered prayer.\n\nIn Isaiah 41:21 the Bible says, \"Produce your cause, says the Lord; bring forth your strong reasons, says the King of Jacob.\" This means present your case methodically.\n\nAgain it says in Isaiah 43:26: \"Put Me in remembrance, let us plead together; declare it that you may be justified.\" Again this means to do a systematic presentation before the Lord!\n\nSecret #7\n\nLearn to Pray for Others Too\n\nGod does not want us to be selfish with our prayers. He wants us to pray for one another. Please note that this does not exempt anyone from praying for themselves. What our modern Christianity has done is give some people the impression that others must be praying for them while they do nothing.\n\nHere's a secret: as you learn to pray for yourself, others will feel drawn to pray with you in agreement. And you will see better results.\n\nSecret #8\n\nBe Serious with Prayer\n\nOne of the 2 cardinal principles I teach is the Midnight Prayer. It is a sharp, aggressive, TIME-DRIVEN take-no-prisoners type of praying that I insist all Christians who want to live productive lives MUST learn. Oh yes, I got that from the Bible.\n\nPrayer is serious business. I am not talking about the sleepy kind of praying that we were taught to pray in Sunday school... the kind that never produces much result. I am talking of forceful and powerful praying ... the type that affects people in a profound way, tangible way.\n\nPrayer is warfare. No more. No less. It is not a joke. It is wrestling, a bend or break, make or mar affair - don't let anyone tell you different. Look in the Bible and study the examples of people like Elijah, Moses, Jacob, Jesus, Paul, etc.\n\nTo bring things closer to home, you only have to read the amazing testimonies all over this site to confirm this is true...\n\nSecret #9\n\nAdd Fasting to Your Prayers\n\nFasting helps to subdue the flesh and this allows the spirit to arise and tune into God's divine frequency. Please note that fasting does not force God's hands. It helps to add wings to your prayers.\n\nAnother of the cardinal principles I teach is the Esther Method. It is a type of fasting so powerful I make it a point to integrate it into all our prayer programs. In the Bible, Esther did it. Paul did it. You should be doing it too. In terms of producing fast results, nothing else comes close, especially when combined with midnight prayers and targeted prayer points.\n\nSecret #10\n\nAllow God to Work in His Own Way\n\nDo not dictate how He should answer your prayers. Just let Him do it His own way... in His own time. After all, He is God. Do not try to help Him answer your prayers. He just has so many ways of answering - amazing ways.\n\nFor this you might need to cultivate a very rare virtue in our modern world. It is called Patience. In the Bible, faith and patience always go together. Yes, faith is required. But patience may be required even MORE.\n\nSecret #11\n\nYour Prayer Must be Persistent\n\nEach day brings you closer to the realization of your dreams. Please listen carefully to this: It is not that God is difficult to approach, or hard to convince. The reason you may not see answers to your prayers immediately might just be because of the power of hindrances in the second heaven... the satanic angels that are fighting people day and night. So you must persist like Daniel and like the woman in Luke 18.\n\nIt has been my experience that many people give up just when they are at the edge of their breakthrough. Because they are not able to see things with the eyes of the spirit, the enemy distracts and discourages them just at the point of their miracles! How sad.\n\nSecret #12\n\nPray to a Level of Assurance\n\nIf you pray and doubt is still in your heart, you must go back and pray. And here's one half-truth that has derailed the faith of many: a popular TV teaching that once you ask God for something, He has already given it to you... therefore you do not need to ask Him again.\n\nHalf-truth. That's what it is!\n\nThe Bible says we should ask\nuntil our joy is full...\n\nWhat this type of teaching fails to tell people is that God can indeed pour out His blessings, but satanic powers can decide to wage war against the person, in hopes of diverting it into their storehouses. But as far as God is concerned, He had given us what we asked for... but out of ignorance, prayerlessness and plain old laziness, the enemy can rob people of these blessings, leaving them battered and discouraged.\n\nYou don't believe me? Go study your Bible!!\n\nThe principles I've listed here are so basic that every believer should know them and put them to use. Then we will see more rapid manifestations of the promises of God in every area of our lives."

      "body": "In 1 Samuel 2:3, the Bible says, \"God is a God of knowledge by whom actions are weighed.\" God will never favour you beyond your action of faith. He weighs your actions to deliver your miracle to you. As you are declaring your faith, you must also be acting it because it is in the process of your step taking that your miracle begins to move closer to you.\n\nMaybe you have been desiring to build a house. You don't wait to gather all the money, start with what you have. Go and look for land first and then drop one tipper of sand there. As you do that, the other materials that you need will begin to gather together gradually till the project is completed. Even if it is only 20 blocks you can afford, go and start with it. There is no law that says you must have 5,000 blocks before you can start building.\n\nFaith disregards protocols. If you are waiting for protocol, you will wait very long on the queue. The four men who brought their sick friend to see Jesus must have looked for a way to pass through the door, but when they saw that the place was jammed and no one was ready to make way for them, they broke the roof and let their sick friend down in front of Jesus. And Jesus commended them for it.\n\nNo matter what is threatening your life; be it sickness or poverty, act against it! Don't let any devil suggest any thing to you, take practical steps contrary to the wind that is blowing around you! Every day, when you wake up, be on the move, don't let satan catch up with you. That is how to have daily victories. It does not come by chance, it comes by the violence of faith. Jesus said, \"...The Kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force\" (Matthew 11:12). Which means, the non-violent will lose it by gentleness.\n\nSatan is not a gentleman, the only language he understands is the language of violence. That is why, there is no future for a gentle man in the Kingdom. The gentler you are, the better for the devil. You have to take what belongs to you by force! You have to let the devil see your red eye! Stop negotiating with him, negotiation is the practice of gentlemen. When they see oppositions they run back. But the Bible says that wherever the sole of your feet shall tread upon, has been given unto you for a possession (Joshua 1:3). So, as long as you keep treading, you will keep possessing.\n\nMeditate on these: Luke 15:17-18, 20"

      "body": "Apostle Paul said in Ephesians 3:19 \"....That ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.\" May that become your prayer and your heart cry from today because when you no longer want more of God then you remain in want. What you are filled with or what you are full of is what you pour out. Life around you begins with life within. So everything you see around a man is a reflection of what is within the man. You can not change your outside until you change your inside. You can not improve on the outside until you alter the inside because every product is the result of a process. The product around or outside of you is a result of the process that goes on within you. What goes on within is what flows out without. May you begin to pant for more of God today. \"That ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.\"\n\nWhat are the benefits of His fullness? Number one is grace. The Bible says in John 1:16, \"And of His fullness have all we receive d, and grace for grace.\" You don't have access to grace outside of the fullness of God. It is grace that changes our status from grass. For \"...All flesh is grass, and the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field\" (Isaiah 40:6). Verse 8 says, \"The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.\" When you are full of the knowledge of God's word you have the fullness of God, which guarantees your endurance.\n\nWhat else do you enjoy when you are filled with the fullness of God? John the Baptist was speaking concerning Jesus and he said, \"He must increase, but I must decrease.\" (John 3:30). In other words, \"I need to be empty in order to be filled with the fullness of God.\" Then in verse 31 he said, \"He that is from above is above all...\" When you are filled with the fullness of God you come clearly above all, you enjoy God's supremacy. When you are filled with the fullness of God He takes you above all.\n\nSay that prayer from your heart; Lord fill me with your fullness today!\n\nMeditate on these: Colossians 2:9-10, Ephesians 1:22-23"

      "title": "The Benefits Of His Fullness!",
      "body": "My greatest prayer for you is \"...That you might be filled with the fullness of God\" (Ephesians 3:19). When you are filled with the fullness of God you enjoy the fullness of His blessings. Colossian 2:9-10 says, \"For in him dwelleth all the fullness of God bodily. And ye are complete in Him...\" So, when you are filled with the fullness of God you enter into a state of completeness, you become complete. That means you will never be in want because God is never in want. In Him you are complete spiritually, socially and physically. His fullness in you absorbs all your inadequacies and inefficiencies. That is why when you are filled with His fullness, people look at you as someone who is error-free because God is now the one at work in you. The fuller you are of God, the more of His grace you enjoy and the more complete you become.\n\nSecondly, the fullness of God in man is the sole destroyer of self in man. When you are filled with His fullness, self is submerged and made to give way. Self prevails over man when he is empty of God. You can't carry God and still be struggling with flesh. You must carry God in order to convey God. And how much of God you are able to convey is determined by how much of Him you carry. Prophet Isaiah said, \"In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple\" (Isaiah 6:1). He saw the Lord, He became full of God and he began to show God to others. He began to convey God because he now carried God. You can't be full of God and go unnoticed among men. Only those who have been touched by God can touch others. So, let God touch you.\n\nRemember that what you are filled with is what you flow out. For instance, a drunkard does not need to practice what to say. Once he is filled with the fullness of wine, he will naturally misbehave and have plenty of jargon to say. So, you don't need to practice how to behave God, just be filled with God and you will naturally behave God. You don't need to practice to heal the sick, healing will just flow out of you when are filled with God. Also, you don't practice the grace of God, you naturally flow in grace when you are filled with the fullness of God.\n\nAnother thing that happens to you when you are filled with the fullness of God, is that you become filled with the love of God. The virtues of God cannot be faked, so love can not be faked. But when you are filled with His fullness, the love of God flows naturally in your heart.\n\nThe fullness of God is our security. The only time we become easy preys in the hand of the enemy is when we are empty of God. The cheapest man for the devil to overcome is a man that is empty of God. You don't fall into sin until you are empty of God. No! A state of emptiness is what gives the devil room to operate. May you be filled with the fullness of God today.\n\nMediate on these: John 14:23, 2 Corinthians 6:16"

      "body": "Worship strengthens the cord of our relationship with God. In worship, your intimacy with God is enhanced. Today, I'd like to show you one major blessing you stand to enjoy as a worshipper.\nWhen you make worship a habitual thing, you gain daily access to the voice of God. If you like call it the voice of direction. In Acts of the Apostles chapter 13 the Bible says, \"\n\"...There were in the church...certain prophets and teachers...As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them\" (Acts 13:1-2).\nI pray that God would find such people who would take time out to fast just to be in worship before the Lord. We need that today. Often times when people fast, it is to ask God for things. But if we would turn our fasting time to times of worship, we would receive divine direction to the things we desire. That is what they did in Acts 13: 1-2, they fasted and worshipped God, they ministered to Him and as they did that, the Holy Ghost spoke and gave them direction; showing them the next step to take.\nWorship lightens the environment, it soothes your spirit-man and stretches out your spiritual antenna to be able to catch the voice of God. This is why Jesus never lacked direction, He was always worshipping God.\nThose major decisions of your life, major steps you want to take that you have been fasting about, I recommend for you to spend 75% of your fasting time in worship. Sing to God, remain in an attitude of hallowing His name, acknowledge your weaknesses and limitations before Him and open up your soul for an encounter with Him. Every time you need a definite word from God, a definite direction on any issue of your life, just worship Him. And because we need direction everyday, worship Him every day.\nWorship time is communication time. And of course, to make the most of that, I recommend that you put your writing materials next to you as you worship because God will certainly speak to you. You need to be ready to document whatever He will say to you for easy implementation.\nOn a final note, I want to say that worship is not something you do mechanically, it has to flow out of you naturally and that happens as you release yourself in His presence. Develop the culture of worshipping God daily and you will never miss your steps again.\n\nMeditate on these: 2 Kings 3:11-19"

      "title": "The ABC's of Abundance",
      "body": "by Kenneth Copeland\n\nRight now many of us are facing needs. Big needs. Needs so great that without the\ndirect intervention of God, they can't possibly be met. Because of that, we need to\nbe more certain than ever before that we understand—and abide by—God's laws of\nabundance. Those laws are extremely important, but, praise God, they're not\ncomplicated. In fact, they're as simple as ABC.\n\nA: Decide to Plant\nIn Mark 4, Jesus compared the workings of the kingdom of God to planting seeds in\nthe earth. \"When the seed is sown,\" He said, \"it grows up and becomes greater\"\n(verse 32). Notice, He didn't say that when the seed is sown it occasionally grows up\nand becomes greater. Or it grows up and becomes greater if it's God's will. He said,\n\"It grows up and becomes greater.\" Period.\nGod's economy isn't like ours. It isn't up one day and down the other. It's always the\nsame and it always works perfectly. If you have good earth, good seed, and good\nwater, you will have growth. It's inevitable. The laws of God will produce that\nincrease every single time. So, if you're facing a need, don't panic—plant a seed!\nThat seed may take the form of time, money, or some other resource you have to\ngive. But no matter what form it takes, you need to understand that the gift itself\nisn't really your seed. There's no life in it. It's just the husk.\nThere are people who've planted husks for years. But, because they didn't put any\nlife in them, nothing ever came up. So don't just plunk a husk in the offering bucket\nwhen it goes by. Put life in it first. Praise and worship God over it. Say, \"Lord, I'm\noffering You my goods to do Your work with, and as I bring You my goods, I bring\nmyself. I give myself to You, spirit, soul and body.\"\nPray over that seed. Fill it with faith, worship, and the Word. Then it will be ready to\nplant.\n\nB: Find Good Ground\nOut in West Texas on my grandfather's farm, there were big, white patches of\ncaliche. It's the most worthless dirt in the world when it comes to planting seed. It\nwon't grow anything. I don't care how fine your seed is, if you plant it in caliche, you\nwon't get a crop.\nThere are some ministries that, spiritually, are just like caliche. They aren't good\nground for your seed. So before you give, pray about where that gift should go.\nDon't rely on your own judgments. Don't reason it out and say, \"Well, this preacher\nover here is screaming and crying and saying he's going under, so I guess I'll give to\nhim.\"\nYou go to the Lord of the tithe and find out where He wants you to put your money.\nHe's the only one who can direct you to truly good ground every time.\n\nC: Water It!\nOnce your good seed is in good ground, keep watering it with the Word of God.\nSpeak faith over it all week long. Call forth the growth of that seed by \"calling things\nthat be not as though they were\" (Romans 4:17). It may just be a little seed, but\nyou need to start calling it grown.\nYou may say, \"Well, brother, I believe in telling things like they are.\" You won't ever\nsee any growth in your life then because spiritual things grow as words are released.\nThat's God's way.\nCharles Capps says the one who \"tells things like they are\" is like the guy who went\nout on the porch to give his dog a bone. When he got out there, he found the dog\nwasn't there—just the cat. So he started saying, \"Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.\" His\nneighbor said, \"I thought you wanted to give that bone to the dog.\" \"I did,\"\nanswered his friend, \"but I like to say it like it is—and the cat, not the dog, is the one\nthat's here.\"\nDon't be like that guy. Call the dog. He'll come. Water your seed with words of faith.\nDon't call poverty if you don't want poverty. Call yourself prosperous. Call that need\nmet. Before long, you'll be so full of joy and so full of expectancy that even the\nwatering will be fun!\nPlant the seed. Find good soil. Water it. Then as Mark 4:27 says, all you have to do\nis \"sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed will spring and grow up.\"\n\"But I don't understand how that works!\" you say. It doesn't matter. Just do it. Plant\nand water. Sleep and rise. Sure enough, one of these mornings you'll wake up to an\nabundant harvest!"

      "body": "Blessing is our heritage in God. That is why we talk about showers of blessing. Genesis 1:27-28 says, \"...God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them...\" After God created man, the first thing He did was to bless him. God did not curse man, He blessed him. Even though it was only Adam that God created at the beginning, the Bible says, He blessed them, because He knew that Adam would multiply. That is to say, when God was blessing Adam, you were in him. The day you were born into the world is not the day you began, you have been in existence since Adam! That is why God said, \"Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee...\" (Jer. 1:5). So, when God said to Adam, \"You are blessed, be fruitful and multiply\", you were there.\n\nIf check very well you will see that there is no curse in the first two chapters of the Bible, only blessings. Curses came in chapter three of Genesis, after man fell. So blessing came before curses and that means blessing is stronger than curses. God blessed man and whatsoever God does is forever (Eccl. 3:14). When God blesses, the blessing remains. That is why curses are temporary but blessings are permanent. You have a heritage of blessings; you have been blessed from the foundation of the world. Anything around your life now that looks contrary to blessing came too late. Never you be threatened by challenges, problems, calamities or curses because they came after you have been blessed. Whatever will stop your blessing must be older than God and since there is no such person or circumstance, you are irreversibly blessed!\n\nWhat does it mean to be blessed? It means to be empowered. God has empowered you to prosper; to multiply and be fruitful in all that you do. God's blessing is comprehensive; it is all encompassing. When you are blessed, it touches all areas of your life. He said concerning you, \"...Whatsoever he doeth shall prosper\" (Psalms 1:3). \"Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep...thy basket and thy store. Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and ...when thou goest out\" (Deuteronomy 28:3-6). God also said in Ezekiel 34:26, \"....I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.\" That will become your story this season, in the name of Jesus.\n\nIf you have been blessed in some areas of your life but you are still experiencing dryness in other areas, it simply means you are yet to come under the showers. But in this season, I see God bringing you under the showers of heaven. You will never know dryness again! Be blessed!\n\nMediate on these: Deut. 7:14, Num. 6:24-26"

      "body": "This is our season of showers of blessing because God always crowns the year with His goodness (Psalm 65:11). It is therefore important for you to know your redemptive access to God's blessings. As we saw in the previous devotional, the first thing God did after He created man was to bless him (Genesis 1:27-28). There was no curse in the beginning, only blessings. Curses only came after Adam fell into sin, but the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:17, \"...If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\" From the day you surrendered your life to Jesus Christ, your root and linage was changed from that of curses to blessings, you are now in the family of God; the family of blessings. 1 Peter 3:9 says, \"...knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.\" That means by redemption, you are actually invited and initiated into blessing. The word 'inherit' simply means to take over what you did not labour for but which has been laid up in store for you. Just as every bonafide child has access to the parents' inheritance, not by labour, but by birth, you also have access to the blessings of God by your New Birth through Christ Jesus.\n\nProverbs 10:22 says, \"The blessing of the Lord makes rich and He adds no sorrow with it.\" What makes rich is the blessing of the Lord, not your labour. God's blessing package for you is comprehensive, it covers all aspects of your life; spiritual, physical, material and social. For instance, Genesis 1:27-28 says, \"...God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply...\" Which means when a male and female come together as husband and wife, they step into the blessing of fruitfulness, it is already waiting for them. Every properly married couple have a guarantee for fruitfulness! So, no matter what is happening around you right now, God says, \"Be Fruitful!\" That is both a blessing and a decree. And psalm 127:3,5 says, \"...Children are an heritage of the LORD...Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them....\" So, you can have as many children as you desire!\n\nSecondly, you have access to the blessing of supernatural prosperity. Jesus came to be our substitute in poverty according to 2 Corinthians 8:9: \"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.\" He took our place in poverty and gave us His place in prosperity. So, to be born again and still suffer lack is an abuse on redemption. God redeemed you to enrich you.\n\nThirdly, you have the blessing of supernatural success. Deuteronomy 28:13 says, \"...The LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath...\" That means you have an heritage of headship wherever you find yourself. Take note of the phrase 'above only.' The only place you are permitted to be is above. So, the blessing of the Lord enriches all areas of life. That shall be your portion in this season.\n\nMediate on these: Genesis 22: 17, Deuteronomy 28:6"

      "body": "The word meditate means \"to consider deeply, to reflect upon, to revolve in the mind.\" It is akin to the physical process of food digestion. Food when eaten undergoes three major processes before the nutrients in it can benefit the body. They are: digestion, absorption and assimilation.\n\nOften we think that the taste of food in the mouth and its weight in the stomach is all that there is to food. But until these three processes take place, food taken in offers no value to the body.\n\nSimilarly, until the Word of God you hear or read is broken down to assimilable forms and you contact the gems in it, your life can not be bettered by it. The meditation process is what breaks down the Word into assimilable forms, equipping you to walk on the highways of the miraculous.\n\nThy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts.\nJeremiah 15:16\n\nThe time that many people allot to prayers should actually be dedicated to meditation. In times of difficulty you hear people ask, \"Have you prayed through?\" But no one asks, \"Have you thought through?\" But solutions come easily as you settle down to think through scriptures. The best of the covenant is accessible only to successful \"meditators\".\n\nThis book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.\nJoshua 1:\n\n..........\n\nSometime ago, while meditating on John 1, I saw how cheaply one can destroy the stronghold of darkness with light. I discovered that there is no contesting the supremacy of light in any conflict against darkness. I discovered the power of light.\n\nShortly after I went to my hometown for Christmas and was told that one of my cousins had been afflicted with insanity. When I learnt this, I was excited, because I saw an opportunity to manifest the truth of the Word I had just encountered.\n\nSo I went to the room where he was. And as soon as I entered, he prostrated to greet me, he could recognise me in his mad state! I asked his brothers to put him in my car, saying, \"Let me see the devil that will follow him into my car.\" We had scarcely driven a few kilometers when this cousin of mine fell sound asleep (he had not slept in days)!\n\nWhen he was taken to the teaching hospital the following day, he was asked, \"What is wrong with you?\" But he replied, \"Do you mean what was wrong with me or what is wrong with me?\" The doctors needed no further proof that he was healed! The same young man has since graduated from the university and is now working!\n\nAnd the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\nJohn 1:5\n\nMay God make you a successful \"meditator\" on His Word."

      "body": "It is God's will for you to prosper and be in control of great affluence but one very important question we need to answer is, how do you prosper? How do you get money? In this Kingdom you don't run after money to get money. Jesus said, \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you\" (Matt. 6:33). In this Kingdom, money is supposed to be an addition; it answers to covenant practices, one of which is what we want to look at here.\n\n3 John2 says, \"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.\" The prosperity of your soul is the foundation for your material and physical prosperity. If you want to enjoy guaranteed prosperity, your soul must first prosper, your soul must first be fed fat and the food of the soul is the word of God. When your soul is fattened by the word it reflects in the material prosperity and wealth you enjoy.\n\nThe word of God is the fountain for wealth. How? Poverty is a spirit and it operates in the realm of darkness. The word of God is light, and it is the answer to every form of darkness around you. For the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehends it not (John 1:5). When you allow the word of God to gain entrance into your soul, you are introducing light and as you do that, darkness begins to diminish. As you intensify the light, darkness continues to withdraw until it becomes extinct. The stronger the light, the weaker the darkness. It is a process. It may look as if nothing is happening for a while, but from the moment you begin to introduce the light of God's word, something has begun to happen. As the light approaches, darkness begins to give way. That is why the word of God is the answer to any depth of poverty in your life.\n\nWe have numerous testimonies of people who were living in abject poverty, but as they came to Church and began to give attention to the word of God, their story began to change and today they have undeniable testimonies of prosperity. Maybe you are in a similar situation right now, just allow the word to feed your soul, very shortly it will begin to reflect on your body and all around you because darkness will always give way to light, as long as there is light, darkness has no power.\n\nThe cheapest way the devil keeps people in poverty is by taking away light from them, he keeps them busy, jumping all over the place, chasing money, contracts and all manner things, which often times, they don't get. So, they become too busy to have time for the word of God and as a result they remain in darkness and in poverty.\n\nAs long as you keep introducing the word, poverty will have no hiding place in your life. If only you will intensify your desire for the word of God, whatever poverty is around your life now, can't last, it will soon give way to abundance.\n\nMediate on these: Psalm 1:2-3, 112:1-3"

      "body": "It is God's will for you to have daily victories because according to 2 Corinthians 2:14, He makes us to triumph always and in every place. However, victory is faith determined. \"...This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith\" (1 John 5:4). And how do you express faith? It begins with your perspective or view about life.\n\nIt is the picture you see that attracts you to the future you desire. Some people, in a bid to obtain victory in certain areas of their lives, fast and pray till they become like skeletons, yet victory is not in view. Look, no matter how much you are praying, if you can't see a picture, you will never arrive your future. So, stop struggling in prayer and fasting, if you want to enjoy victory, eat very well so that you can see very well from God's word. It is only what you see that you are permitted to possess.\n\nFaith begins with perspective, but what is faith perspective? Faith perspective simply means, \"God has determined my end irrespective of the circumstances I am going through.\" It says, \"I am a finished product, I am just in the process of emergence. God finished me before He started me, I am already a concluded entity with a predetermined destination of glory. No matter what is happening around me now, my ultimate end is glory.\" You can't have such perspective to life and still burry your head in sorrow or despondency.\n\nWhen you see conflicts and oppositions around you, that is the time to lift up your head and look from where you are to the place you want to be; according to the discoveries you have made in God's word. Jesus said, \"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh\" (Luke 21:28). It is when you lift up your eyes that all the goods and blessings that are due to you begin to come your way. Can a man whose head is bowed down see good when it is passing? This is the reason many people are permanently in defeat. They are too bowed down. And you know, those who keep looking at the floor will soon end in the pit. So, look up! Never be moved by all the negative things that satan is showing you.\n\nIn fact, the devil is too small to show you your end, because he was not there when God was creating you and programming your destiny. God created you to have dominion. So every thing that comes your way in the negative, came late because they came after God had finished His work. That sickness in your life came late! That is why the Bible says, \"...But from the beginning it was not so\" (Matt 19:8). Whatever you are experiencing negatively now, was not so from the beginning. So, change your perspective.\n\nWhen you have a clear picture of your future from God's word, you don't need to pray much again, you simply make declarations till it begins to manifest.\n\nMeditate on these: Romans 8:30, Jeremiah 29:11"

      "body": "A greater percentage of what happens to you in life is determined by your attitude. There is a popular saying that your attitude determines your altitude. And one way to cultivate a good attitude is by living offense free. Offence is a destroyer of destiny. Many people are defenseless because they are cheaply offended. God can only defend you when you are not offended in Him.\n\nThis is very clear from the story of John the Baptist in the Bible. He was sent of God to preach about the coming of Christ and to prepare the way of the Lord (Matthew 11:10). But along the line he began to preach against Herod so Herod arrested and put him in prison. While in prison he heard about the exploits that Jesus was doing and he sent two of his disciples to ask Him, \"...Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?\" (Matthew 11:3). This was the same man who had announced Jesus as the much-awaited Christ; the Messiah. He had publicly introduced Him saying, \"...Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (John 1:30). But he soon became offended and began to question God.\n\nJesus said in Mathew 11:6, \"...Blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.\" Which also means, \"Cursed is he, whosoever is offended in me.\" Offenses open the door to the curses of life. You know what happened to John the Baptist? He lost his head to a little girl. We are told in the Bible that one day, Herod made a feast for his officials and captains to mark his birthday, the daughter of Herodias (his brother's wife whom he had taken over) danced to entertain Herod and his guest and he was pleased. So he swore to the little girl, \"Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.\" But the girl's mother advised her to ask for the head of John the Baptist and it was given her (Mark 6:21-28). When you are offended you lose your defense and when you lose your defense you become a cheap prey in the hand of the devil.\n\nAlso in Hebrews 12:15 the Bible says, \"Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.\" From this scripture, satan's has three major objectives for buffeting your mind with offences. When you find yourself always taking in offence over relevant and irrelevant issues, it is an indication that satan wants to block your access to the grace of God. And you know when grace is absent, failure is inevitable. Secondly, offence leads to bitterness, which is the root of many troubles that people are suffering today, in their bodies, businesses and otherwise. Most marriages that have ended in divorce today, is as a result of the couples being bitter against each other.\n\nThirdly, bitterness leads to defilement. And to be defiled means to be unclean, desecrated and unfit. So living in offence makes you unfit for divine presence and when God is not with you, everything will be against you. As long as you are in the world, offences will surely come but you have to cultivate the attitude of living offence free in order to keep climbing to higher altitudes in life.\n\nMeditate on these: Matt.18:7, Phil. 1:10"

It says, \"For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people...\" To cover means to spread over. The darkness of economic crunch is spreading all over the world. That is why some people run away from their own nations to other nations only to discover that things are not better there, because the darkness is covering the earth. The economic crunch is biting in all nations of the earth! \"Gross darkness\" means total darkness, and it shall cover the people. But the good news is, there is exemption an for God's people because the second part of that scripture says, \"...But the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.\" That means while the people of the world are hungry, you will be feeding them. While they are selling their properties, God's people will be buying, we will be gaining while they are losing.\n\nThat was happened in the land of Egypt when God came down to bring His people out of bondage; He made a distinction between His own people and the people of Egypt. God's people stayed in a place called Goshen and while the rest of Egypt was suffering plagues, hunger and darkness, there was peace in Goshen. God's people were not touched by any of the plagues, they did not suffer the darkness that was in the land of Egypt neither did they lack anything. Also, in the days of Jacob, when there was severe famine in the land, he still had money to send his children to Egypt to buy food.\n\nThere is a covenant of exemption for God's people, but it only answers to light because Isaiah 60:1 says, \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.\" Light represents the word of God because \"The entrance of thy words giveth light...\" (Ps. 119:130). It takes the light of God's word to escape the gross darkness that is coming on the world. That is why Isaiah 60:2 says, \"For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: But the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.\" And how will the Lord arise upon you? Through the arrival of light. The glory of the Lord will only be seen upon you when your light has come. So, you must let the light come. You must give attention to the word till it gains entrance into your soul and when your soul is fed, it will begin to reflect all around you, everything you do will prosper and blossom.\n\n\"...the LORD shall arise upon thee...\" Wherever God's word is, God will always arise because God and His word are one and the same (John 1:1).

That is why whoso takes away knowledge from you has taken away blessings from you. Until the book was delivered to Jesus in Luke 4:16-17 and He found what was written concerning Him, He remained a carpenter's son. But after He located and read that portion of the Bible, He said to the people, \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.\" So, your access to knowledge is the beginning of your deliverance. This is why God lamented in Hosea 4:16, \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\" Every suffering is traceable to ignorance. You are poor not because of the economy of your nation, you are poor because of ignorance.\n\nStop running around! It is not the people you know or the people you don't know that determine your prosperity, it is the God you know. \"For the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits\" (Daniel 11:32). Instead of waiting so many hours to see somebody who promised to help you with some money, why not use that time to look for God? Man is limited! He can never give to you what God will give you. If you use half the time you spend lining up at the office of some rich men, to secure knowledge from God's word, your life will change beyond your imagination. Before you know it, you will even become richer than the men you are pursuing.\n\nGod said, \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\" They are destroyed, not because provisions has not been made, they are destroyed for lack of knowledge. So the greatest lack of man is knowledge. When you are no longer in want of knowledge, then you will no longer be in want of things. God has already made provision for all your needs to be met, He has provided for you everything that pertains to life and godliness, but it takes knowledge to secure them.\n\nWhen Jesus was crucified on the cross, we are told that before He gave up the ghost, He said, \"It is finished!\" That means, \"I have not left anything undone. Everything humanity will ever need has been completely provided. The price for your total restoration; for your good health, comfort, prosperity, success, has been paid.\" But the greatest joy is that He did not only finish the job, He also left for us a legal document, the title deed of our inheritance.

So, just as a lawyer would stand in court, not to beg but to declare what is written in the constitution to justify his claims, you also are to take the word of God and declare it in order to clear what belongs to you. All that you need has been provided, yet God says, \"Put me in remembrance...declare thou, that thou mayest be justified\" (Isaiah 43:26). It is not enough for you to have the book or to cram the scriptures in your head, it is important for you to declare it if you must see the blessings materialize in your life.\n\nThere is the story of two brothers in the bible, one of them is popularly known as the Prodigal son, while the other is simply known as his elder brother. The Prodigal son was aware of his inheritance, he knew the provisions that had been made for him so he went to his father and said, \"...Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me\" (Luke 15:12). And because it was his legal right, his father could not deny him, so he gave him share of the inheritance. It is true that the Prodigal son went and spent his inheritance on riotous living but the important point I want to focus on for the purpose of this teaching is that he had an understand of his covenant right and he took advantage of it. His senior brother who was older than him sat down in ignorance. Even when he was hungry he would not ask for food, he never one day asked for anything from his father. That is why you can be in the Faith for 20 years, if you have no understanding of your covenant rights, somebody who just came in two years ago will be more blessed than you. The bible says, the first shall be the last and the last shall be the first. So, beware lest others take your place!\n\nEven when the Prodigal son returned from his journey and he was reunited with his father, I believe he saw the fatted calf walking around the compound and he said, \"Father, can we have this for a feast? At least as a proof that you have received me back home.\" And the Father said, \"Why not?\" So they killed the fatted calf and made a feast. The father put a ring on his finger, changed his clothes and put shoes on his feet; everything he wanted on the account of knowledge, he got it. Then, his elder brother came home in the evening and when he learnt that his prodigal brother had returned and that their father made a fest for him, he was angry and said to the father, \"...These many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.\" There are many people like that in Church, who are angry at the prosperity of others. Please understand that the reason you are poor is not because somebody else is rich. The father in that parable said to his elder son, \"...Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.\" (Luke 15:29-31). The provision has been made, so the reason you have not is because you ask not. And you ask not because you are ignorant of your legal rights.

To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary\" (Luke 1:26). This verse marks the beginning of the happenings that led to the first Christmas- the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ. It began with a visitation. And angel was sent from God to a virgin called Mary. So, Christmas is not just a time of eating and drinking, it is a season of divine visitations. Just as God sent angel Gabriel to the village of Nazareth to locate that young virgin, I perceive that an angel is being sent to locate you right where you are now.\n\nMary was hiding in a corner where nobody knew her, in a village that was probably not on the map of their nation, yet, an angel was sent to her. Bible history makes us understand that there were only 12 houses in the village of Nazareth, yet the angel went and located Mary in that small settlement. In modern times, such a place may not even qualify to be called an hamlet, but when God wants to visit a man, where he is located on the earth does not matter. No matter where you are now, I know that something is about to happen for you. This is your season of visitation!\n\nYou may feel that nobody knows you. You may even be asking, \"Who will remember me?\" But I want you to know that God has remembered you and right now you have been located. \"...The angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, named Nazareth. To a virgin...\" Now, who is a virgin or what is a virgin? A virgin means something that has not been tried before; an untested material, something that is new, fresh. Please know that God has come to locate you as a virgin today. You may be wondering, \"How am I new? How am I a virgin?\" The bible says, \"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are becomes new\" (2 Corinthians 5:17). Mary was not just physically a virgin, but she was a woman not used to the things that were being told her by the angel. So, each time you feel that what you are being told from the word of God is new to you, or something you are not use to, at that time you are a virgin. It means God is about to do something unique in your life.\n\nChristmas is all about visitation; visitation for change of status. When the angel came to Mary it was for a change of status because after that encounter her life never remained the same. From the hidden corner where she was, she became a recognized figure, not only in her time but for generations after. In her testimony she said, \"...My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my saviour. For He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed\" (Luke 1:46-48). That is what Christmas is all about; a change of status, God taking you from your low estate to the top, where you become a reference point for all generations. I want to say to you this day, that if you will open up your heart for God's visitation at this season, by Christmas next year, you will have a big story to tell!\n\nMeditate on these: Genesis 50:24, Luke 1:45"

    "title": "The Fundamental Pillar For Prosperity!",
    "body": "Many have always thought that prosperity begins with giving because the Bible says, \"Give and it shall be given unto you.\" Giving is good but it is not the beginning of prosperity. It goes beyond that. The journey to prosperity begins with consecration, giving is at the peak of the ladder. If you want to see prosperity, you must seek God first, consecrate yourself, walk uprightly, after that, you can now sow your seed. Just as farming begins with the clearing and cultivating of the ground before planting your seed, prosperity begins with consecration. Giving without consecration makes you a loser. If you check the story of Abraham in the Bible, you will discover that it was not at the beginning of his walk with God that he was asked sacrifice Isaac. The first thing God demanded of Abraham was perfection. \"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly\" (Genesis 17:1-2). So, multiplication answers to perfection.\n\n2 Timothy 2:19 says, \"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure...And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\" The foundation for every blessing of God is consecration, you must first depart from iniquity. Only those who become iniquity-free become abundance-full. Only clean hands become prosperous hands. People who go for prosperity by crooked means don't know how much they are cutting short their abundance. Our covenant fathers were blessed because they walked uprightly. When Jacob's children brought back the money that he gave them to go and buy grain from Egypt, he didn't hold it, he sent it back. Infact he gave his children double money to go back to Egypt and buy more grain (Gen. 42:35, 43:11-13). That is upright walk! Let your hands be clean! Whatever is not yours don't touch! In Genesis chapter 14 when Abraham returned from a battle, the king of Sodom told him to take whatever he desired from the loot of war. It looked like a wonderful offer but Abraham said, \"I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD...that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich\" (Gen 14:22-23). That is to say, \"I have made a vow that I will not touch what is not mine. \" And because Abraham refused the counterfeit, God gave him the original. God appeared to Him and said, \"...Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward\" (Genesis 15:1).\n\nThose who seek to go on the fast lane will end up on the far lane. Going on a very fast lane does not cut the journey short, it only lengthens the journey. The faster you think you are, the farther the journey becomes for you. In the covenant, you don't go on a fast lane, you rather go at the speed of God. When you refuse to go at God's pace, you loose God's peace. It is gong at God's pace that guarantees His peace.\n\nMeditate on these: Psalm 5:12, Psalm 84:11"

    "title": "Holiness Does Not Reduce People!",
    "body": "It's quite amazing to hear some Christians say, \"Ever since I gave my life to Christ things have been very hard for me.\" They are simply exhibiting their ignorance because Jesus said in John 10:10, \"...I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\" That is a complex combination of blessings. He said, \"...I am come that they might have...\" So, the reason Jesus came is to make you have, not make you suffer loses, He came to make you have everything that makes for comfortable living. And He did not stop there. He said, \"...and that they might have it more...\" That connotes ceaseless increase; as long as you are in Christ you are programmed to keep having more and more and more until the perfect day. And as if that is not enough, Jesus further said, \"...and that they might have it more abundantly.\" That means having all good things in excess. So, when you repent and you give your life to God, you have access to excess blessings.\n\nThe reason many are saved and are still suffering is simply because of ignorance. The Bible tells us in Proverbs 13:15, \"Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.\" And you know favour also means blessing. So the level of favour you enjoy is determined by the proportion of your good understanding. \"...The way of transgressors is hard.\" Who is a transgressor? A transgressor is an ignorant man. Since he lacks understanding he keeps walking contrary to commandments of God and as a result life becomes hard for him. Hard life is the portion of the ignorant but good understanding procures favour.\n\nNow, the first thing you must understand about prosperity is that it begins with holiness. The most holy God is also the richest God. We are told in Job 1:1-3, \"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.\" Note that the first qualities of Job was not his wealth or his greatness, but his uprightness, his perfection, the fear of God and his hatred for evil. He was a man that loved God and abstained from evil, he was never given to shady deals. That was the foundation for his wealth and greatness. So, holiness does not reduce people, holiness is not synonymous to poverty, rather holiness opens the door for abundance. The story of Job's life shows to us that you don't have to be crooked to be rich.\n\nJob 22: 23 -- 25 says, \"...Thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust...and thou shall have plenty of silver.\" God will never put his blessing where there is iniquity. Do you want His blessing? First put away iniquity from your house, then you will lay up gold as dust.\n\nMeditate on these: Psalm 1:1-3, Psalm 34:10"

    "title": "It Is Your Turn To Be Favoured!",
    "body": "\"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.\" This was the salutation of angel Gabriel to Mary when he came to inform her of the birth of Jesus. It was a strange salutation, it took Mary unawares because the Bible says, \"She was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.\" She was a virgin, she was not used to such salutation. She must have wondered in her heart, \"Are you sure this message is for me?\" Mary was not the only virgin in Nazareth but favour located her. My message to you in this Christmas season is that it is your turn to be favoured! By virtue of your experiences in the year 2004 you may be wondering like Mary, \"What kind of message is this?\" But in that passage, the angel said to her, \"...Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God\" (Luke 1:28-30). I say to you today, you have found favour with God!\n\nTo be favoured means to be graciously accepted; to enjoy what you do not qualify for. That is what God is delivering to you today. It is your turn to enjoy unique favour, unmerited blessings from heaven. When you find favour with God, strange and unique blessings follow. After the salutation of favour, the angel told Mary, \"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS\" (Luke 1:31). That is not a common blessing, especially for a virgin. Through the word of God that is coming your way right now, I see you getting conceived of great ideas and expectations for the coming year. I want to advice you to do as Mary did. Even though she did not understand the message of the angel, she opened up to receive it. She did not look like it, her circumstances were completely contrary to what the angel was saying, but she opened up her heart to receive what God had for her. Your mind is too small to comprehend all that God has in store for you. You know, the Bible says His ways are higher than our ways and His thoughts than our thoughts, that is why God will always speak big things into our small minds.\n\n\"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God\" (Luke 1:34-35). When favour comes, the power of the Holy Ghost is released upon you to bring to pass the things that God has spoken concerning you. And the reason is because what God wants to do in your life cannot be manufactured in the factory of men, it can only be established by the power of the Highest. So, stop looking at your natural resources. When you are favoured, things begin to happen for you supernaturally. Ezekiel 2:2 says, \"And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me...\" As you receive the word of God right now, it is conveying to you, the Spirit and life of God, to cause the impossible to come to pass for you.\n\nMeditate on these: Luke 1:37, Psalm 44:3"

This news was very very strange to Mary and she naturally asked, \"How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\" And the angel said to her, \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee...\" But he did not stop there, the angel began to tell Mary of some other miraculous acts of God. He said to her, \"...Behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible\" (Luke 1:36-37). I don't know what you are projecting for the year ahead, may be you have checked it and you don't see how it can be done by human strength, but I want to tell you that with God all things are possible. In the year ahead of you, what men say is not possible, shall become a cheap possibility for you by the power of God!\n\nChristmas reminds us of God's ability to turn impossible situations around, it reminds us that with God all things are possible. He said to a virgin, \"You shall conceive and bare a son.\" And concerning Elizabeth that was said to be barren and past the age of bearing, He said, \"She has conceived in her old age.\" I don't know what you are planning and projecting for the coming year, you may look too small in your own eyes for it, you may even look too far away from it, but with God all things are possible. May be in the past few days, you've been struggling to get money to celebrate Christmas and New Year and it has been very difficult, but because all things are possible with God, by this time next year, people will gather around your table to eat with you!\n\nRemember that Christmas is all about change of status. The angel came to announce to Mary a change of status -- a virgin that was once hiding in a little village became the mother of the Saviour of the whole world; a woman to called \"Blessed\" in all generations. I see a change of status coming for you! That is the miracle of this season and I don't want you to miss it! Next year Christmas will not meet you where you are now!\n\nThe angel said to Mary, \"...Blessed art thou among women.\" I see God singling you out at this season to bless you, He has chosen you from among your peers and colleagues to lift you.\n\nMeditate on these: Mark 9:23, Luke 1:45"

    "title": "The Principle Of Seed Time And Harvest!",
    "body": "While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest...Shall not cease\" (Gen 8:22 --NKJV). One of the irrevocable laws of life is the law of seed time and harvest. It is a principle that cannot be changed no matter what you do. And I would advice you to always have it at the back of your mind as you relate with people. The phrase, \"seed time and harvest\" implies that nothing happens by accident, if you see good, it is an harvest of the good you have sown because whatever a man sows, he will reap in multiples (Gal. 6:7). So, the question is, what kind of seeds are you sowing in your relationship with others? I'd like you to search your heart sincerely. If somebody were to pray for you and say, \"May you reap what you have sown towards me.\" Can you say, \"Amen\"? If your parents or parents-in-law said, \"May your children do to you as you have done to me.\" What would be your response? The law of seed time and harvest cannot change and we are told that it will last for as long as the earth remains, it is not temporary. Only the termination of the earth can stop it. I am not trying to put fear in your heart but to let you know that life calls for caution. You can't afford to relate with people anyhow! You have to pay attention to details. Beware what you are sowing in the lives of others, either in words or actions!\n\nIf you ever dream of becoming a leader in future, start relating with your present leaders the way you would like your subordinates to relate with you when you also begin to lead. The reason I don't have any problems from the people that work with me is because I have always submitted absolutely to the leadership under whom I am privileged to serve, so I enjoy maximum support from everyone that works with me. I have sown a seed and I am reaping the harvest.\n\nI know of a man who used to operate a brothel before he became a Christian and even after he started coming to church, he was still running the place. But one day it occurred to him that his growing daughter may soon join the ladies in the brothel. And immediately he went and closed down the place. Since he would never like his own daughter to be there, he had to stop keeping other people's daughters there. Life is all about doing to others what you want them to do to you. Whatever you won't take, don't give to others. If you were put in charge of the establishment where you are working presently, how would you like the staff to work with you? Such reasoning should help you to put in your best on your job. And you must understand that God will always use what belongs to another man to test your preparedness for your own. Jesus said, \"...If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?\" (Luke 16:12). You never have yours until you manage other people's own well. Whatever you are able to lay down for others you will always receive back in many folds.\n\nNo matter what people do to you, just keep doing good to them because the Bible says, \"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good\" (Rom 12:21). So, it is easier to overcome evil with good than to overcome evil with evil.\n\nMeditate on these: I Peter 3:13, Luke 6:27-28"

    "title": "How Friendly Are You!",
    "body": "Relationship is an inevitable part of life; as long as you are alive you must relate with people. And the Bible says, \"A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly...\" (Proverbs 18:24). It is how friendly you are that determines your acceptance among people. Let me give you a few tips on how to be friendly:\n\nBe Approachable!\nLearn to interact with people! Don't reject others, because it is other people's patience towards you that has brought you to where you are now. You are not a self-made man, other people made inputs into your life to make you what you are today. So, learn to tolerate others. Tolerance is the grace for mutual coexistence. It is also an evidence of maturity. People who cannot tolerate others are often the biggest nuisance in the society. No matter how anointed you are as a pastor, if you are intolerant, you will never be able to draw a crowd talk less of keeping them. The Bible says, \"...The servant of the Lord must...be gentle unto all men...\" (2 Timothy 2:24). Never make yourself too difficult, rather be approachable. People who look too hard loose more respect than they earn.\n\nDon't Make Yourself Untouchable!\nLet what touches others touch you. Jesus was able to affect so many lives because He was a man of compassion. Whenever he saw people suffering or in need, He reached out to them. That is why the Bible says, \"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities...\"\"Jesus wept.\" Why? Because He loved him! (John 11:35-36). So it was not only the prayer of Jesus that brought Lazarus out of the grave, it was the compassion in His heart. In the same way, the most hardened person will open up to you if only you would show him compassion. If the needs of others don't touch you then never expect your needs to touch God. The largeness of your heart determines the number of people you can accommodate, which is also the number God will draw to you.\n\nMake Room For Offences!\nNever make yourself 'un-offend-able.' If somebody offends you and says, \"I am sorry\", forgive him and put the issue behind you. Many men have lost respect in their homes because they can't forgive their wives. But I often tell them, if your wife does not offend you then you are not her true husband. The standard scripture I use to maintain harmony in my family is, \"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it\" (Ephesians 5:25). Christ loves the Church immeasurably and unconditionally. That is why He keeps forgiving us every day. And that is the way we should love others. Something you must understand about relating with people is that offences must come (Luke 17:1). You can't have people around you and not occasionally have them offend you, so make room for the shortcomings of others.\n\nMediate on these: Colossians 3:12-13, 1 John 3:17"

    "title": "Respect Others!",
    "body": "We are looking at the subject of Initiating Good Relationships and today I want to talk about 'Respect.'\n\nDo you know why David was so much loved in Israel even as a youth? He had respect for others! The Bible says that he behaved himself wisely in all his ways (1 Samuel 18:14). David respected Saul, even though Saul wanted to kill him. When he had opportunity to kill Saul and escape he said, \"No I can't touch God's anointed.\" But one day he disrespected a man called Uriah; his own staff. David took the man's wife and schemed his death, but he did not escape the consequence. He was disrespected in return by his own son who drove him off the throne (2 Samuel chapters 11, 12, 15).\n\nMen who are fond of disrespecting others, including their wives, will get it back some day; they cannot escape being disrespected in return. I heard of a junior officer that was being harassed by his superior in the public. He did all he could to appease the senior officer but the man kept abusing and calling him names. So he removed his uniform, threw it away and slapped the senior officer. On lookers who were watching them said, \"Very good, it serves him right!\" Please respect others. Even if you are a superior, don't use it as an advantage to disrespect your subordinates or to deprive them of their rights. If nobody is respecting you, then ask yourself, \"Do I respect people?\" Because the measure with which you mete to others, the same will be used to mete back to you (Luke 6:38). Respect is earned not self-imposed or demanded; as you give it, you get the same in return. So, let 'respect' be your watchword in your relationship with others. Don't shout down other people's views. Let them express their foolishness as you once expressed yours before you became wise. You were foolish yesterday, you only got wise today so give others room to grow as well.\n\nIt is not age or education that earns you respect, it is your wise behaviour towards others. You can be a driver and be more respected than the one you are driving. There are people who are charming while others are contemptible, simply because of their attitudes. What most people call persecution is often times a natural reaction of others to their foolish behaviour because a man who does not know how to relate well with people will naturally suffer rejection. Wrong presentation kills good ideas. So, learn to present yourself in a way that compels people to open up to you. Look for how to gain acceptability anywhere you find yourself, not through eye service or by imposing yourself on people, but through wise behavior.\n\nMeditate on these: Psalm 49:20, Romans 12:10, Colossians 4:5 It is one of the keys that you need to be able to relate well with people. If you have respect for others you will not have any problem relating with them. Whosoever you respect will respect you in return, no matter the difference in age or cadre. If you respect your parents, your children will respect you in return. You know, even children need to be respected. If in the name of correction and upbringing you keep humiliating your children till they lose their sense of worth and dignity, they will grow up not knowing how to respect others. So, respect them.\n\nMediate on these: Colossians 3:12-13, 1 John 3:17"

    "title": "What Is Grace?",
    "body": "Grace comes from God, it is His exclusive reserve and He does not give it on the basis of merit. We have always thought that grace is just unmerited favour; God giving you what you do not qualify for or putting you on the line when it is naturally not your turn. That is only an aspect of grace, but it is beyond that because you can earn favour through hard work or any other means and still not enjoy grace. But you can't earn grace, yet once you have it, you have favour.\n\nGrace, in it's fullness, is divine help or 'divine take over.' No matter how strong you are, there would be times in your life when you need a divine 'link' to take over for you. So, grace is a divine leverage; something you can lean on when you become exhausted or when you get to your wits' end. Grace is not faith or effort, it is a divine reserve that enables you to start the journey with renewed vigour when you would naturally have given up. So when you get to a cross road and you don't know what next to do or your efforts seem not to be producing the desired results, don't feel condemned, simply link up to grace. Call for grace, no matter the area of life in which you need it.\n\nThe Purpose of grace is to raise men. Until grace locates you for a raise., you remain a struggler. However, the man that qualifies most for grace is not the smart, strong or eloquent, but the helpless. Moses was at the back of the desert, where he had fled due to frustration and helplessness. But when grace located him he went from rearing cattle to become one of the greatest leaders that ever lived.\n\nPaul the apostle wrote more about grace than any other apostle because of the great lifting that he enjoyed. He said, \"For I am the least of the apostles...\" That means he did not have the qualifications that others had. But he said, \"...By the grace of God I am what I am...\" (1Cor. 15:9-10).\n\nGrace also raises dead issues back to life. It gives you fulfillment through the supply of all sufficiency in all that you require to make it in life. \"...God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work\" (2Corinthians 9:8). To be 'sufficient' means to be able, adequate and competent. So, when you have grace you have enough in all areas of your life.\n\nOften times, the challenges of life require that you exceed your size or operate beyond the realms of human abilities. That is when you need grace because grace means operating with the ability of God. When you have grace you have God and whatever cannot stop God will never be able to stop you. It is my prayer that all through your life, the grace of God will not fail you.\n\nMeditate on these: Isaiah 46:3-4, Psalm 40:17"

They have mind-boggling results that are capable of intimidating anyone into saying, \"What more can I do that has not already been done? There is no use trying.\" But there is a covenant secret for running with mighty men and overtaking them despite your 'smallness' or seeming limitations. That secret is the grace of God. Outside of grace, we are nothing but grass. Behind the making of any man in the Kingdom of God is the grace of God, because the Bible says, \"...Ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and...the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty...That no flesh should glory in his presence.\" (1Cor. 1: 26-29).\n\nThat means, what looks like a handicap or limitation in your life is the very reason God called you. He wants to make nonsense of the wisdom of the world. Until you understand and appreciate the mystery of God's grace, you cannot attain His best for your life. Until you know how to articulate the grace of God in your life, you may end up in disgrace.\n\nWinning in life goes beyond human strength. Of course, you require smartness, tireless input, wisdom and skills to make it in life. All these are necessary but they are grossly insufficient to give you the kind of success that God has ordained for you. No wonder the Psalmist said, \"Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord watch over the city the watchman waketh but in vain\" (Psalm 127:1).\n\nYour efforts are good, but they are not enough! The builders build and watch men watch! Those are efforts, but except you link up with the Lord, they end in vanity. But when you have the grace of God, every input you make is amplified to produce unimaginable results. There are many people who are very smart, yet they are losers because \"...It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy\" (Romans 9:16).\n\nLife is futile without grace! Goliath was a mighty man of war with many years of experience and expertise, yet a stone from a little boy's sling, which ordinarily may not have killed a bird, brought him down.\n\nNo matter how weak you think you are, the grace of God is available to take over for you and put you where you may naturally never get to in life. At the same time, if you think you are a strong man, let me remind you that there are people and forces that are stronger than you, and except for the grace of God, you will remain in struggles. You can't make any impact in life except God has imparted you. You are never made, until He has made you, so what makes you is the grace of God.\n\nMeditate on these: Zechariah 4:7, 2 Corinthians 12:9"

Let me show you what this will do for you.\n\nWhen Moses prayed for God's presence in Exodus 33, God said to Him, \"My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest\" (Verse 14).

    "title": "Your Access To Divine Grace!",
    "body": "The starting point of grace is salvation. The grace of God is available to all who are saved, but not all have access to it. The ticket that gives you access to grace is humility. James 4:6,10 says, \"...God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. ...Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.\"\n\nHumility simply means refusing to overestimate yourself or count on your credentials and giftings. There is no crime in being gifted, but you run into trouble, when you take your eyes away from God and depend on your gift. The measure of grace you enjoy is a function of your level of humility. In his time, Moses was the meekest man on the face of the earth, no wonder he enjoyed so much grace (Numbers 12:3). If you maintain humility, you will never need to beg for grace. A proud man is the one who counts on his abilities and constantly thinks that he is more qualified than others, but the humble man relies heavily on God.\n\nAlso, grace is only for those who acknowledge their need for God's help. Look at the story of king Asa in 2 Chronicles 14. The Bible says that he had \"...an army of men that bare targets and spears...and...that bare shields and drew bows...all these were mighty men of valour\"\"And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.\" And the Lord destroyed all his enemies before him (2 Chronicles 14:12).\n\nEven though Asa had everything needed for battle, in his prayer he said, \"For we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.\" That was what brought the victory. The acknowledgement of your need is what opens the gateway of grace to you. Only those who acknowledge their need for Him qualify for His grace.\n\nWithout God we can do nothing but you must acknowledge your helplessness before you can link up to divine power. Don't pretend to be self-sufficient or claim to be what you are not. God does not lift the already lifted. He is looking for the helpless and the lowly, who are heavily dependent on Him. So, the earlier you acknowledge your total dependence on God, the sooner you will begin to enjoy His grace.\n\nIf you have been living outside the zone of grace, it is time to return and say, \"Lord, I am no longer trusting in myself, but in You.\" Don't wait till you are tired of pushing before you call for grace, call for it even before you step out for the day. You must learn to rely heavily on God and have no alternatives beside Him. Put your case in His hands and take your rest, that is your escape route from shame.\n\nMeditate on these: 2 Chronicles 20:12, 2 Corinthians 3:5 (2Chronicles14:8). But when the Ethiopians came against him in battle, he did not trust in his men nor in his weaponry."

    "body": "Humility is your access to grace but you require boldness to release grace. Humility is not synonymous to fear that is why Hebrews 4:16 says, \"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\"\n\nThe grace of God is not for weaklings. Only bold people enjoy grace. If you want grace to work for you, you must be strong in your heart. Grace does not jump on people, it is attracted through boldness. Grace is not a substitute to boldness, it is only a booster for it. Only the daring can activate grace and the way to be daring is to face the challenges that come your way rather than dodge them. When you face challenges, grace is supplied to you to phase them out. When you don't challenge grace, it withdraws.\n\nIn Matthew chapter 14, the disciples of Jesus were sailing across the sea in a boat and there was a tempest. Suddenly, they saw Jesus walking on the water towards them and they were afraid because they thought He was a ghost. But when He said, \"It is I, be not afraid\", only Peter said, \"Lord if it is you bid me come.\" And when Jesus said, \"Come\", he dared to step out of the boat unto the water. You don't attract grace by remaining in the boat, you attract grace by daring to step out. Many people talk about how Peter sank after taking two steps on the water, but nobody talks about the other disciples who remained in the boat.\n\nThe man who dared to take steps was the one who enjoyed the grace of God, because as he began to sink and he cried out, Jesus reached out His hand of grace and drew him up. And from there they walked back to the boat together (Mathew 14:25-32). So, Peter did what all the other disciples never did, he walked on water because he dared to take a step. When you take steps, not relying on yourself but on the help of God, even if you begin to sink along the way, grace will take over for you. If you want to see grace in action, be daring!\n\nGrace also answers to diligence. Grace does not work for you until you work. That is why no lazy person can attract grace. Grace follows those keep working. The only way to stop the effect of grace is to remain static. Apostle Paul laboured more than all the other apostles and that was why he enjoyed more grace than they all. So, your drive determines the extent of grace you enjoy. The more you work, the more grace you have, so keep adding more to your work in order to enjoy more grace. God anointed Jesus with grace, because He went about doing good, He was not sitting in one place. Grace is provoked to produce! So, if you want to see great results, keep making efforts and the grace of God will be released to multiply the effects of your efforts.\n\nMeditate on these: 1 Corinthians 15:10, Joshua 1:6a"

God is not a hoarder of His grace, He is a giver of grace. If you position yourself correctly you will never lack His grace. This is how to do it:\n\n1) Keep acknowledging your source. In every place and at all times, proudly display your identity as a Christian, let everyone know your connection to God and your dependence on Him. If you forget God He will forget you. The reason many believers don't have sustained blessings is because they soon forget God and begin to pose as achievers, so God withdraws from them. As God keeps lifting and blessing you, remain levelheaded. Constantly remember where you where before He brought you to where you are now.\n\n2) Beware of praise singers. If you are a lover of commendation you cannot escape being proud. And you know the Bible says, \"God resists the proud.\" Often, over commendation is condemnation in disguise. So, you need to device personal spiritual principles to deal with commendation. For instance, I prefer people to challenge me to work harder than to commend me. If you must escape the trap of pride, when people commend your good works, learn to quickly give God the glory and acknowledge Him as the doer, both in the secret and in the open. There is nothing God is doing through you or for you today that cannot be done through any other person, you are only privileged to be the one He chose to use or to bless.\n\n3) Go for knowledge. 2 Peter 1:2 says, \"Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ.\" The more knowledge of God you have, the more His grace is multiplied to you. Outside of the knowledge of God there is no passage for grace. People are limited in life, not because challenges are insurmountable but because they lack the required knowledge to contact the grace that they need to overcome. The link between you and God's grace is the knowledge of the word, as you keep building up knowledge you will keep growing in grace. Rejection of the word is registering for shame and disgrace. Disgrace means, reduced grace. When a man is ignorant of the word he is graceless and that is what brings about disgrace. You will not suffer disgrace again! Be blessed, in the name of the Lord!\n\nMeditate on these: Psalms 106:21-23, 1 Cor. 15:10"

    "body": "For the believer, there is no survival outside of the word of God. That is why satan will do everything he can to keep you from the word; the word is his greatest area of attack in the life of the believer. When he came to attack Adam and Eve in the garden he said to them, \"Hath God said...?\" (Genesis 3:1). Also, when he came to attack the second Adam in the person of Jesus he said, \"If thou be the son of God as He has just declared from heaven...\" (Matt.3:17, 4:1-11 Paraphrased).\n\nThe fruit bearing process of the word begins with receiving the word. So, in the first instance satan will attempt to stop you from receiving the word. This is evident in the parable of the sower. The sower sowed the seed, some fell by the way side, the birds of the air picked them up, some on the stones and the rocks, satan said, 'I won't let him have root.\" So, the seed struggles to survive. Others fell among thorns and the thorns choked them up. This is why some people get to the point of receiving the word in their heart yet it does not profit them. Mark 4:18 says, \"And these are they which are sown among thorns, such as hear the word...\" They succeeded to a point of hearing the word but \"...the cares of this world...choke the word and it becometh unfruitful\" (Verse 19). The word 'cares' means worries, anxieties and distractions of this world. These are the things that choke the word. The word of God cannot die but it can be choked.\n\nThe conditioning of your heart is what determines the fruitfulness of the word you receive. From that parable you find that it is the same seed, the same sower but different grounds. The word of God is the same but the different attitude of receivers is what is responsible for different results. You must fight anxieties, apprehension and worries because no matter how healthy a seed is, it requires a healthy environment to yield fruit. Beware of concerns! Beware of anxiety! What shall we eat, what shall we drink, what is my future like? What will happen to my wife? What will happen to my children? What will happen to me?\n\nJesus said, \"Who among you, through anxiety can add a cubit to his stature?\" (Matt. 6:27). Have you ever seen a man who worries about his height, and suddenly his height increased? It does not happen. No body grows by anxiety, growth comes as a natural sequence to other processes of life. So, keep your life running on the word by living anxiety and apprehensive free. Anxiety doesn't change the seed of the word, it will rather destroy it. So when the seed of the word is planted in your heart, go to sleep, takes your rest, stop choking the seed. You may not know how, but things are happening."

    "body": "The word of God is the believer's habitat, outside of the word, the believer is like a fish out of water; choking and gasping for breath. Many hear the word, they receive it with joy but once the seed is planted, because of concerns, anxieties and worldly cares in their hearts, it is choked and becomes unfruitful. Satan attempts to choke the word of God out of your heart so that he can choke your life with problems. So, if the word must work for you, you must fight concerns and anxieties. \"Be anxious for nothing...\" (Phil. 4:6).\n\nHow does the word work? Mark 4:26-27 says, \"...So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.\" If you want the word of God to work for you, take your rest, relax, be anxiety free. You don't have to know how the seed will spring forth. Because according to scriptures, \"...The earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear\" (Mark 4:28). The seed has the ability to bring forth by itself, and it will bring forth. So, let the word take its course, let it work by itself! Your heart must be well conditioned to allow the seed germinate.\n\nWorrying is a waste of time because from psychological analysis, the maximum percentage of life's issues that we can genuinely be anxious about is 8%. The remaining 92% of our worries have no basis. Some of the things you are anxious about have already happened and they cannot be changed. Some are issues that will never happen. Others are unfounded issues of life; unfounded imaginations and suggestions of the enemy in your heart, all in a bid to choke the word.\n\nWhat anxiety does is to keep you on the same spot, to choke the word and stop it from working in your life. Even in farming, if you plant your seed and a few days after you go to bring it out to check it, you have reduced its capacity for productivity. If you put it back, it may yield some fruit, but it has already been paralysed. Each time you check God's words over and over again with anxiety and worries you are reducing its effect.\n\nYou must be so relaxed and confident that God's word is doing its work. Leave it there, go to sleep because nothing happens to a man outside of the knowledge of Gods word. Those who rest on the word are truly resting. Psalms 119:165 says, \"Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.\"\n\nMay you be free from every form of anxiety, apprehension and cares of life, in the name of Jesus!"

    "body": "O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever\" - Ps 136:1\n\nThe understanding of God's mercy is one of the greatest revelations of life. Until you understand His mercy you don't truly know the person of God. When Moses said, \"Show me your glory\", God took him up to a mountain and passed by him proclaiming, \"The LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth\" (Ex 34:6).\n\nThe perspective of merit is what disqualifies many believers from God's blessings. We must understand that we are not kept by merit, we do not succeed by merit, we are not outstanding by merit, we are simply blessed by His mercy. \"It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning...\" (Lam 3:22-23). Until you drop your perspective of merit, you cannot enjoy the mystery of His mercy. Stop boasting of your merit, start celebrating His mercy. Those who celebrate His mercy don't miss His acts, they don't miss His miracles because His mercy is revealed in His acts.\n\nYou know why we must keep celebrating God's mercy? If we were to be judged according to our works, many of us would score minus one million, because often times our errors far outweigh our good, but His mercy covers us. Even when we make mistakes, He still marks us right. We have failed several times but His mercy has prevailed. When we are caught in our weaknesses, His mercy keeps strengthening us. For His name's sake He keeps blessing us.\n\nImagine a student who wrote an exam and it was obvious that he scored ten percent, but the teacher had mercy and gave him ninety. And then the student went out and started boasting to the hearing of the teacher. Without notice, the teacher will quietly change the mark to ten again and give it to him according to his boasting. We can't boast because if God judges us according to our merit, we would be nowhere. We are simply beneficiaries of His mercy, so let's keep celebrating it.\n\nI noticed in scriptures that one cry Jesus never turned down was the cry for mercy. Everyone that called for His mercy secured His attention. So, when we celebrate His mercy we are simply registering for His attention. Let your soul be filled today with the thoughts of His mercy. You are where you are today by His mercy, not because you are a prayer warrior. As you keep celebrating His mercy, you will never lack His acts."

    "body": "The test of genuine service is humility. Until you are taken through the test of humility your service is not counted as genuine before God.\n\nPhilippians 2:3 says, \"Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.\" Lowliness of mind connotes humility. It is the opposite of high mindedness. The practice of humility is esteeming others better than yourself; always projecting the well being of others and striving to treat them better. That is what ultimately moves men to serve.\n\nService means taking care of others and contributing to their well being. Or in a nutshell, being useful to others. So if you are not useful to others you are not serving. Service means being useful to people, beginning with your family, your children, your parents, your siblings, the Church and every other community to which you belong.\n\nJesus practiced all of that because in verse 5 we are told, \"Let this mind be in you which was also was in Christ Jesus.\" And then the following verses explain how He did it.\n\n\"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God\" (Verse 6). So, humility does not play the game of equality, it does not compete. If you find yourself always in competition, it means humility is lacking. A humble man has self-esteem, he understands that he is a unique person on a unique mission and on a unique track of life so he does not struggle for recognition.\n\nVerse 7 says, \"But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant...\" Now, there is always a conflict between reputation and usefulness; between significance and relevance. Reputation is a major pursuit of the natural man, there is something in every man that seeks recognition, seeks to be known, but it must be subdued. Jesus, in His service to God, made Himself of no reputation, He did not seek recognition. Rather He took upon Himself the form of a servant. He preferred relevance above significance. Note that He took it upon Himself. So, servant-hood is something you consciously take upon yourself, you make it your choice to serve. Jesus made Himself of no reputation even when He had a chance to do so. It was His choice to serve.\n\nHumility is not a gift, it is a choice. The Bible says, \"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up\" (James 4:10). The self in you will want to do otherwise, but you must exercise yourself into servant-hood through a process of humility in order to encounter God's lifting. You shall be lifted!"

    "body": "Jesus said, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit...\" (John 15: 5).\n\nNo branch survives without the vine. A branch that is cut off may maintain its greenness for a while but it is dead from the moment it was cut off. If you want to know the unfruitfulness of a branch cut it off from the vine. If you want to know the nakedness of a man cut him off from God. Only those who cleave to the Lord remain alive (Deut. 4:4).\n\nWe are permanently tied to the Lord. He said, \"...Without me ye can do nothing.\" He didn't say, \"Without me you can do some things\" but, \"You can do nothing.\" In other words, \"If you want to do anything, you better abide with me. For, with me you can do all things.\" And Apostle Paul said, \"I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me\" (Phil. 4:13). So accomplishment is made possible only by permanent relationship with God.\n\nDeficiency results when man begins to think of self-sufficiency. When you think you are capable you become incapable. \"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God\" (2 Cor 3:5). Never you think you are sufficient because when you think you are able you become disabled. When you think you can carry it, life becomes a load and a burden.\n\nWhen Nebuchadnezzar began to think of himself as sufficient he lost his throne. He boasted, \"...Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?\" While the words were still in his mouth, the kingdom was taken from him and he was sent crawling into the bush to live as an animal. And the voice that spoke from Heaven said to him, \"...Seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will\" (Dan. 4: 29-36).\n\nGod does not call people who have ability, He calls the helpless so that no man may glory in the flesh (1 Cor 1:26-29). God is looking for people who will rely on Him. If Jesus, the saviour of the world, a sinless man and anointed without measure said, \"I can of myself do nothing\" (John 5:30), then your journey is long. You should be lying before God everyday and asking for His help.\n\nKeep acknowledging God as your helper, let the whole world know that He is your sufficiency."

    "body": "Text: Philippians 2:3-9\n\nHumility goes beyond outward appearance, it is an attitude of the heart. Yesterday, we examined the practice of humility as outlined in Philippians 2:3-7. Humility means esteeming others above yourself, serving others, and seeking usefulness above reputation. All of these Jesus did. He made Himself of no reputation but took upon Himself the form of a servant; by choice, not by force. That is humility in action.\n\nPhilippians 2:8 says, \"And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death...\" (Verse 8). Jesus proved His humility through obedience. That is the expression of humility. Make it your delight to obey instructions, as an expression of your humility.\n\nJesus was an extremist in His practice of humility, He was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. That was a shameful death, it was a reproach to be hung on a cross. And in Hebrews 13:13 the Bible says, \"Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.\" In other words, let us identity with Him in humility. Sometimes the practice of humility would bring you so low that it looks like humiliation, yet that is your passage to the throne. Humility is our strongest identity with Christ. He said in Matthew 11:28-29, \"...Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" The end of humility is rest; every humble man will find rest in the ultimate. See where Jesus is resting today at the right hand of majesty.\n\n\"Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name\" (Verse 9). The word 'wherefore' means, 'having satisfied the requirements.' Jesus served to a point of satisfying God. He went through the process of humility and at the end He received permanent exaltation. If you must enjoy such lifting, then serve to a point of satisfying God. The truth is, you cannot make yourself great, you are too small to do that. Your assignment is to humble yourself and let God exalt you, that is His duty. As you remain small in your own eyes, He will make you great in life.\n\nHumility is a core virtue of Christianity. Any Christian that is not humble is simply applying to remain on the ground just as satan was cast down from his place in heaven for despising the virtue of humility. Pride was found him, he exalted himself so he lost his place because pride goes before destruction. That is why we say that humility is the security of your destiny. I pray that God would clothe you afresh with humility today, in the name of Jesus!"

    "body": "\"Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off\" -Psalm 138:6\n\nHumility is a virtue that God cannot resist. Anywhere God sees humility He is attracted. He visits the humble, He reveals secrets to the humble, defends the humble and blesses the humble.\n\nIn 2 Chronicles 7:14 God said, \"If my people, which are called by my name shall humble themselves, and pray...then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin...\" So, the first thing God looks out for when you approach Him in prayer is the humility of your heart. In 1 Kings 21:20-29 we find the story of Ahab, a wicked king in Israel who sold himself to work evil in the sight of the Lord because Jezebel his wife stirred him up. And one day God sent Elijah to tell him of the great punishments that would come upon him. But as soon as Elijah turned to go, Ahab broke down and humbled himself before the Lord. \"...He rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.\" He became sick for fear of God. And God said to Elijah, \"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days...\" There is no record that Ahab said one word of prayer but God was moved by the humility of his heart.\n\nAnd in Luke 18:11-14 Jesus told a parable of two men who went to the temple to pray. The first man said, \"God, I thank you that I am not like other men and these are my credentials; I am not unjust, I am not an adulterer, I fast twice a week and I give tithes of all that I have. I am not like that man over there, he is a sinner.\" But the second man stood afar off, not daring to lift up his eyes, but with his head bowed, smote his chest and said, \"God, be merciful to me, a sinner.\" And Jesus said the second man went home more justified than the first because every one that exalts himself shall be abased and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.\n\nIt takes a heart of humility; admitting your helplessness and inadequacies to receive the mercy of God. Thank God for your perfect scriptural and grammatical arrangements in prayer, but the truth is, you cannot answer prayer. God has given us the power to pray, only He has the power to answer prayer. This should humble you. We are not praying because we know how to pray, we pray because there is a God who answers prayer. Let us humble ourselves before Him and He shall lift us."

Time is innocent, time is harmless, it is what we do with time that defines the outcome. The Psalmist said, \"I will bless the Lord at all times.\" All, excluding none. Blessing the Lord at all times is the key to continuous blessings because when you keep blessing Him, He also will keep blessing you.\n\n\"...And His praise shall continually be in my mouth.\" This is the Old Testament version of 1 Thessalonians 5:18 which says, \"In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.\" So, every circumstance should meet you in thanksgiving and leaves you in thanksgiving. There is no time to murmur.\n\nAgain, Ephesians 5:20 says, \"...Giving thanks unto God always.\" Thanksgiving is not just what you do, it is the life you live; you live out your thanks to God. If you stop at voicing out your thanks to God, it is incomplete because your voice is only a part of you. Genuine thanksgiving must involve your entire being and your whole life -- your utterances, thoughts, attitude, actions, everything!\n\nThanksgiving is an attitude that must be cultivated and expressed habitually.

When you thank God, you are simply telling Him, \"I know this situation before me is a cheap possibility with you.\"\n\nAt the tomb of Lazarus Jesus said, \"Father, thank you because you hear me always.\" In other words, \"I know you will do it.\" And God did it. When you offer thanks, you are making your boast in the Lord and as you boast in the Lord, He begins to boost your destiny.

And often times, they complain because of covetousness and greed. But the Bible says, \"And having food and raiment let us be therewith content\" (1 Tim 6:8).\n\nAt the root of thanksgiving is contentment. Contentment does not connote acceptance of the status quo, it is rather appreciation of the present in anticipation of the future that you see ahead.\n\nThere is a difference between acceptance and appreciation. To accept your situation means, \"I know I will never leave this position, I can never get anything better than this in life.\" But appreciating it simply implies that you value the process of development and growth in your life. Appreciation is an expression of value. \"I value where I am, I know it is not a mistake for me to be here, it is only a process of life and I thank God I am passing through it.\" That is appreciation and at the root of it is contentment.\n\nOne day, Jesus was surrounded by over 5,000 hungry men and all the food His disciples could find were five loaves of bread and two fishes. And one of them said, \"What are these among so many?\"(John 6:9). But Jesus said, \"Lets have it here.\" He took the loaves and gave thanks. That is a sense of value. He had value for what was available at that time and it became more than enough to meet the need.\n\nWhat somebody else disdained and said, \"What can these do?\" Another person picked it up with a sense of value and there was multiplication. You never can tell what you could become in life until you begin to appreciate where you are now. You never can tell what you could possess until you begin to appreciate the little that you have now.\n\nAppreciation is born out of contentment; being happy with where you are, having a sense of value for what is available per time in view of what you believe is coming your way.\n\nGod gave the Israelites manna in the wilderness and rather than appreciate it they murmured, so He destroyed them (1 Cor 10:10). Murmuring is the process for stagnation but thanksgiving is the process for multiplication. The choice is yours!\n\nMeditate On These: - Malachi 2:1-2, Psalm 92:1"

But it does not stop at that, it also creates what you desire.\n\nOn two occasions when Jesus was to feed thousands of people in the wilderness, He took the little provision that was available, gave thanks and began to distribute it. As He did that there was multiplication, the force of thanksgiving created more food and all the people had enough to eat, with plenty left over (Matt.14:15-21, John 6:5-13).\n\nSo, thanksgiving is not just an expression of gratitude, it is also a declaration of your expectation. And as you declare it, the process of creation is activated to bring it to pass because Proverbs 24:14 says, \"...Thy expectation shall not be cut off.\"\n\nThat is why, thanking God only for what He has done is the realm of babes in the faith; it is the practice of those who are limited to what they can see physically. But the matured, thank God ahead for what He is yet to do, which he has seen with the eye of faith.\n\nThanksgiving leaves no room for regrets. Thanks givers never regret because they believe that all things are working together for their good even when it is obviously contrary. They still say, \"Father, thank you, I know this will turn to my good\" and ultimately it turns to their good.\n\nThanksgiving is the multiplication factor of life. No one ever thank God and reduces. Tomorrow will never meet a thanks giver where yesterday left him, because thanksgiving is a seed of appreciation and whatsoever a man sows is what he reaps. When you sow appreciation your reap appreciation. Your life naturally appreciates when you give thanks.\n\nMultiplication is the natural sequence to thanksgiving. So, thank God for that salary in your hand, thank Him for that open door of blessings you have, for the job you are doing, your children, your family.\nYour life will multiply.\n\nMeditate On These: - Malachi 2:1-2, Psalm 92:1"

And for you to gain access you have to fulfill the requirement: enter with thanksgiving. Access is automatic the moment you come with thanksgiving.\n\nNothing shuts a man out of God's blessings like murmuring, grumbling and ingratitude. But the more thankful you are the more access you gain.\n\nIn Hebrews 6:12 we are told, \"...Be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.\" Faith is what you require to move God to fulfill His promises towards you but the peak of faith operation is thanksgiving. When Jesus arrived at the tomb of Lazarus and told the people to take away the stone, Martha his sister said, \"Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.\" But Jesus replied, \"...If thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God.\" And then He went ahead to demonstrate His faith by saying, \"Father, I thank you!\" And he that was dead, came back to life (John 11:39 -41).  \n\nRemember the ten lepers in Luke chapter 17? They cried out for mercy and when Jesus saw them He said, \"Go, show yourselves to the priest.\" As they went, the miracle took place, they were cleansed. One of them turned back immediately, falling on his face and glorifying God with a loud voice. When Jesus saw him He said, \"Thy faith (which you expressed in thanksgiving) has made you whole\" (Luke 17:19 paraphrased). There was no verbal expression of faith from the man, he only returned to give thanks and as far as Jesus is concerned, thanking God is an expression of faith in God.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the highest form of faith is thanksgiving. There is no dimension of faith that competes with it.\n\nYour prayer may offend God but your thanksgiving can never offend Him. He can be tired of your prayer but He can never be tired of your praise. He said, \"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me...\" (Psalms 50:23). So, thanksgiving is your final signature in the school of prayer because it is the will of God concerning you (I Thess. 5:23 ) and every time you do His will, you qualify for the fulfillment of His promises (Hebrews 10:36 ).\n\nThanksgiving is also an expressing of confidence in God. Hebrews 10:35 says, \"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.\" When you express confidence in God, your reward is guaranteed.

So, when you gain access into God's presence, manifestations are bound to follow.\n\nIsaiah 40:28-31 says, \"...Hast thou not heard that the everlasting God...fainteth not, neither is weary?...He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he increaseth strength. Even the youth shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fail. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength...\"\n\nThe major benefit of God's presence is strength renewal, you exchange your weakness for His might. When you connect with God, you contact His power. And when you contact divine power, every earthly problem becomes cheap to handle.\n\nPower means ability, when you contact divine power, you are enabled to do the things you couldn't do before. Also, in this kingdom it is power that delivers blessings. Deuteronomy 8:18 says, it is God that gives us power to get wealth. 1 Peter 1:5 says, we are kept by the power of God. So, nothing works without power. Captivity is turned when we contact God's power in prayer.\n\nMoreover, we require power to overcome temptation, as satan tempts us with all manner of evil everyday. It is in God's presence that we receive the ability to resist Him and live a sanctified life. That is why Jesus said in Luke 22:40, \"Pray that ye enter not into temptation.\" The answer to temptation is in God's presence because when you are full of God you can't have any place for evil in your life.\n\nIt is lack of power that makes many Christians to beg and negotiate with satan over the blessings that God has already given to them. But those who are full of power simply exercise authority. They issue decrees and whatever they decree is established. That will be your testimony from today!\n\nMeditate on these: Acts 4:23-33, Psalms 84:7"

If you must understand the secret of Jesus' success, then you must find out the things He was doing. From scriptures, we find that Jesus was a man of quietness; He often separated Himself to solitary places, especially the mountain or the wilderness in order to be alone with God. And in Matthew 17:1, we are told He took three of His disciples along so that they also could experience the things He had been experiencing.\n\nVerse 2, \"And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.\" Right before His disciples, Jesus was transfigured, and the transformation was so strong that even His cloths were affected. This implies that, everything we bring into God's presence encounters a change. This is why people can receive their healing by merely touching you. It is as a result of the excess virtue that flows through you after you have been transformed in His presence.\n\nYou can't take your business or family issues to God's presence and they will remain the same. And if you make your home a place of encounters with God, you cannot but see His visitation there.\n\nVerse 3, \"And behold there appeareth unto them Moses and Eliahs talking with Him.\" We are told in Hebrews 11: 22-23 that every time we come to mount Zion, we fellowship with innumerable company of angels and the spirits of just men made perfect. That is why we have the reproduction of the ministry of such just men in our midst today. Because in fellowship, their anointing rubs off on us. So, we have people who minister like Elijah, others like Moses, and some others who minister like David in songs.\n\nVerse 5, \"While he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, \"This is my beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased, hear ye Him.\" Until you are approved of God you have no place among men. Until you have encountered His voice, you don't have a voice on the earth. Men will hear you only to the extent you have heard from God. And all of these, you stand to enjoy in His presence.\n\nI am showing to you how to enjoy continuous transformations and changes in all areas of your life.

He said, \"Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away...\" (Isa 6:6-7).\n\nThe tongue of man has great impact on his destiny because life and death are in the power of the tongue (Prov. 1821). Whether you live or die, win or lose, is determined by what you say with your tongue (Mk.11:24). Until Isaiah's lips were touched with the coal of fire, his destiny did not open up. He had a great call of God upon his life, but until that encounter, he couldn't answer the call. All his troubles and limitations were tied to his tongue. So, the angel came and touched his lips with the coal of fire and said, \"Thine iniquity is taken away.\"\n\n'Iniquity' in this context does not necessarily connote living in adultery or any of such evil, 'iniquity' could also mean weaknesses, inadequacies; the things that make a man unfit or unable to carry out God's assignment for his life.\n\nAfter the angel touched Isaiah's tongue with the coal of fire, there was no more hindrance. When he heard the Lord, saying, \"...Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?\" He answered, \"...Here am I; send me.\" And then the Lord said, \"...Go, and tell this people...\" (Isa 6:8-9).\n\nSo, one of the things that happen to us in God's presence, is that our weaknesses, limitations and inadequacies are burnt off with the coal of fire from the altar so that our destinies can open up. Also, God's presence is a place of transparency, where you are revealed to yourself. That was why Isaiah said, \"...Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips...\" (Isaiah 6:5). He saw his nakedness and insufficiency before God so he cried out. Remember, angels excel in strength so the angel that touched Isaiah's lips with the coal of fire actually came to strengthen him.\n\nAfter such encounters in God's presence, you can confidently say, \"Here am I, Lord send me. I thought I couldn't do it before, but now send me.\" That is why those who cultivate the habit of staying in God's presence end up becoming a show piece to their world. His presence is the place where you get spiritually equipped to appear before your world; that is where you receive grace to function in your God given assignment. So, whenever you are in His presence, focus on building up spiritual strength.\n\nMeditate on these: Zechariah 3:1-4, Luke 22:41-43"

And that connotes growth.\n\nThe only way to grow in life is to learn. Let's look at a simple real life illustration. You must have noticed that there are some of your classmates in primary or secondary school who cannot stand with you now, because they dropped out of school and settled for life at that point. They stopped learning so they stopped growing.\n\nSometime ago one young man told me a story from his childhood days. He said when he finished primary school, for lack of funds in the family, he couldn't go on to the secondary level, so he became a street boy, hawking things. And one early morning he was hawking local soap from one compound to another when he saw a small girl who used to be his classmate in primary school coming in his direction. She was now a high school student and very well dressed. He said, when he saw her, he dropped the tray of soap and ran away. Because, through education, the girl's status had been so enhanced that he could no longer stand by her.\n\nSo it is in every facet of life, learning will always enhance your status, or at least it gives you a better chance to be enhanced. So, if you must grow you must learn. And this is not limited to formal education, it includes spiritual, business, social, etc.\n\nIn the adventure of life there is no permanent position. The Bible says, \"The first shall be the last and the last shall be the first.\" You must keep moving if you don't want to be overtaken and thrown to the back. And that calls for personal efforts and input, because no one can grow for you. I can only motivate you to grow, I cannot grow for you. Even though the Bible says concerning husband and wife that the two are one flesh, I cannot grow for my wife because we are still individuals. So each person has to accept personal responsibilities.\n\nWhen you stop learning you stop growing. And whatever is not growing will start dying, that means it will start suffering reduction till it is no longer relevant. Stop wishing for your status to change, start learning and you will start shinning.\n\nMeditate on these: Luke 13:6-7; 2 Peter 3:18 (Prov 4:18)."

Then at 18 you see a young man that you used to carry as a baby, now developing beards. Change is the proof of growth.\n\nIn the same way spiritual changes occur in our lives as we grow in the knowledge of God. \"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord\" (2 Cor. 3:18). As we behold Him we are changed from being sicklers to healers, from beggars to givers, from unrighteousness to the fear of God.\n\nThe more you learn, the more you are changed, and when you make learning a continuous exercise, your changes will also be continuous. So when you don't learn you are missing continuous changes.\n\nAlso, the essence of growth is to build up maturity. When we grow, we are maturing and the reason we must mature is to express our sense of responsibility and capacity for the greater things that God has in store for us. You will agree with me that your sense of responsibility determines what is committed into your hand per time, just as you would determine what to give to your child at a certain age, in order not to destroy him. You give him what his capacity can handle, which is a function of his maturity.\n\nIn the realm of the spirit also, God will commit into your hand only what you have the capacity for. We are all desirous of great things but we must grow for great things to happen. Galatians 4:1-2 says, \"...The heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all...\" That means, as long as he is a child, he will be treated as a servant, and even worse than a servant.\"...But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.\"\n\nIf you want to take delivery of your inheritance, you better grow because as long as you remain a child, you remain in bondage. What qualifies you for your inheritance is spiritual maturity, and spiritual maturity comes via growth. Growth is a product of learning. So, it is not you, who is waiting for God to bless you, it is rather God who is waiting for you to mature for your blessing. Failure to learn is refusal to grow, and refusal to grow is denial of your inheritance. Get committed to learning.\n\nMeditate on these: Eccl. 10:16-17, Ps. 102:16"

To experience continuous development, you must give yourself to continuous learning.\n\nIn I Peter 2:2 the Bible says, \"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.\" The journey to personal development begins with desiring the word of God. And your attitude must be that of a new born baby. Have you seen a little baby crying for milk from the mother? His attitude is that of desperation. And as soon as his mouth locates the breast he begins to suck vigorously, with clenched fists. That is how you should desire and long for God's word.\n\n\"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.\" You begin as a baby but you don't stop there, you grow from the milk level to the meat level. And how does that happen? Through exercise. Hebrews 5:14 says, \"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.\"\n\nFrom the meat level you go on to the honey level. Proverbs 24:13-14 says, \"My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste: So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.\" As a babe, you desire but as a son you have a responsibility to find it. That means you go in search of the word and when you have found it your expectation shall not be cut off. At that realm you simply possess your possessions, when you decree a thing it is established unto you.\n\nBut the link between babyhood and sonship is exercise. Growth comes via exercise and you exercise yourself by applying the things you learn. It is not just enough to desire and acquire knowledge, it is the application of knowledge that leads to profiting. \"...Give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all\" (1 Timothy 4:15).\n\nYour foremost duty as a believer is to acquire and apply the word of God to your life. You acquire it by desiring it, you apply it by exercising yourself; declaring the word, taking steps in line with scriptures and doing what you are commanded to do. Acquiring the word takes you only to the realm of awareness, it is exercise that takes you to the realm of possession.

    "title": "Heart Connection: Root Of Effective Prayer!",
    "body": "Christianity is not a religion but a relationship. That is why Jesus said, \"When ye pray say, our Father which art in Heaven...\" Not, \"Oh my God...\" He is God to the whole world but He is 'Father' to us. So, we are in relationship with God and the livewire of every relationship is communication. For instance, no matter how much you love your spouse, if there is no communication between the two of you, your relationship is likely to die off. Relationship thrives on communication. And as Christians, we communicate with God through prayer. Prayer is our medium of communication.\n\nHowever, you will agree with me that the genuineness of any communication is determined by the extent to which the hearts of the individuals are involved, otherwise whatever the mouth says would not be taken serious. This is why many believers pray and it doesn't go anywhere, because there is no heart connection.\n\nGod places much emphasis on the heart of man because that is the 'engine room' of his life. Even physically speaking, once the heart stops beating, the man is gone. Jesus said, \"Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks\" (Matt. 12:34). Everything that comes out of the mouth is first processed in the heart. A man can disguise his appearance and even pretentiously say the right words to please his hearers but he cannot disguise his heart. So, in the school of prayer, it is the heart before utterance. God sees your heart before He hears your voice. \"...For the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart\" (1 Sam 16:7).\n\nIn 1 Samuel chapter 1, Hannah was in the temple praying to God for a male child because she had been barren. And while she prayed, Eli the priest was watching her and he saw that only her lips moved, her voice was not heard, so he accused her of being drunk. But Hannah said, \"...No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD...for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto\" (1 Sam 1:15-16). Hannah's heart was so deeply connected in prayer that she forgot about the physical activity of speaking out loud. Yet, God heard her and granted her request.\n\nAccess to God demands all of your heart not all of your shouts or all of your cries. He said, \"And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart\" (Jer. 29:13). Whenever you are in prayer, before you speak, ensure that your heart is connected because prayer without the heart is no prayer.\n\nI see your prayer life taking a new turn from today.\n\nMeditate on these: Isaiah 65:24, Prov. 16:1"

    "body": "As we saw from the previous devotional, the state and condition of your heart is what determines heaven's response to your requests. You may have noticed that sometimes before you even pray, while your request is still in your thoughts, God sends the answer. That is because He sees your heart before He hears your voice. He said, \"...Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear\" (Isaiah 65:24). Your heart connection provokes heaven's response just as much as your utterances in prayer, if not faster.\n\nSo, what is the kind of heart that gets God's attention? He said in Jeremiah 29:13, \"And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.\" When we search for God with all our hearts we gain access to all His power. The reason many do not get results in prayer is because they are there with all of their bodies and only a quarter of their hearts. Do you want to get all of God's attention every time you approach Him? Then give Him all of your heart. He said, \"My son, give me thine heart...\" (Prov. 23:26).\n\nThe phrase \"with all your heart\" connotes whole heartedness. It implies a virtuous heart; a heart that is full of virtues or good qualities. That is the kind of heart that gets God's attention. When you approach Him in prayer, He looks at the qualities of your heart before He considers your perfectly articulated utterances.\n\nWhat does it mean to seek God with all your heart? It simply means approaching Him with the right attitude. A whole hearted seeker is a man with a right attitude. A right attitude commands heaven's attention much more than the longest or loudest prayer. We are told in Mark 5:25-34 that the woman with the issue of blood said in her heart, \"If I may but touch the hem of his garment, I shall be made whole\" and she got her miracle.\n\nJesus talking about the heart connection said in Matthew 12:34-35, \"...How can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.\" So, the treasures (attitudes, thought patterns, understanding) of a man's heart determine his utterances and ultimately his outcome in life. That is why the Psalmist said, \"Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer\" (Ps. 19:14). May the state of your heart not betray your utterances before God.\n\nGod has no problem answering prayers, if we approach Him with the right attitude we shall always see the manifestation of His power and glory.\n\nMeditate on these: Ephesians 3:20, 1 Kings 8:38-39"

And the amplified version of the Bible translates 'fervent' as 'heartfelt.' A fervent man draws strength from his heart, not his physique. That is why it called heartfelt prayer. It is the major factor that compels continuity and consistency in prayer. That is when prayer is strong and long. For instance when Elijah went up to the mountain to pray for rain, the answer did not come the first time. He \"said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not\" (1 Kings 18:43-44). It takes heartfelt involvement in prayer to be able to stay on till the answer comes.\n\nIn Luke 22:44, just before His crucifixion, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. The Bible says, \"And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.\" Jesus prayed with such intensity that His sweat was like great drops of blood, yet we are not told that He shouted. Often times when most people pray you can hear their noise but can't feel their hearts. But when prayer is heartfelt and earnest, you may not say too many words, your voice may not even be heard, but your heart can be felt.\n\nThe key to answered prayer is spiritual desperation -- a longing for God. It is the yearning of the soul and the intensity of desire that brings the heart to a state of brokenness where prayer compels tremendous power that is dynamic in it's working. So, we must prepare our hearts in prayer. Every time we approach God lets appear like people who really want what we are demanding in prayers.\n\nWhen the hearts of men are prepared God cannot hold back the floods of heaven. On the day of Pentecost the heavens broke loose because the hearts of men were panting. They were waiting continuously in prayer till suddenly a rushing mighty wind came, the flood of the Spirit was released and cloven tongues of fire were on them all (Acts 2:1-4). There must be a fountain springing from the soul of man before there can be a deluge from heaven. May you experience that deluge of heaven's release today!\n\nMeditate on these: 1 Samuel 1:15"

That is, the attitudes or qualities of the heart that God looks for when we approach Him in prayer.\n\nEven though God demands humility in prayer, you don't have to be jelly-like. You need confidence to lay hold on what belongs to you. Hebrews 4:16 says, \"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" Boldness is our access to the throne of grace, so if you don't have it, don't bother to come. Prayer is not a begging exercise, it is a negotiating exercise, and in any negotiation, boldness is a major requirement. God said, \"...Let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified\" (Isaiah 43:26). That requires boldness of heart. And boldness is a product of knowledge and wisdom (Isaiah 41:21, Eccl. 8:1).\n\nHebrews 10:35 says, \"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.\" If you are not bold in prayer you will miss your reward. Elijah was very bold when he prayed down fire on Mount Carmel. He said, \"Hear me now Oh LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God...\" (1 Kings 18:37). And then the fire fell. Any man who will pray fire down, does not pray beggarly prayers. You don't beg fire to come down, you command fire to come down.\n\nJesus taught His disciples, \"After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven...Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread...\" There is no where He said, \"Please.\" It is all with confidence. If you look at Abraham's prayer when the Lord wanted to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, he said, \"Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?\" (Gen 18:24). And God said, \"I will spare the city.\" Abraham kept up the negotiation, from fifty to thirty, to twenty and then ten. And God still said, \"I will spare the city if ten righteous are found there.\" Confidence!\n\nWhat is the basis for confidence in prayer? (1) The understanding that God is your Father. You can ask Him anything at anytime. You don't need long notice to come into His presence because the access has been made for you by the blood of Jesus Christ! You are a proper child of God, so approach Him with confidence. (2) Know the will of God concerning your desire. \"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.\" (1 John 5:14). Has God said it? Then we can ask Him according to what He said. You don't fight your child for asking for his school fees because apart from the fact that he is your child, you are the one who registered him in that school. So, you are committed. In the same way, God is committed to answering your prayers when you ask  according to His will, so be confident.\n\nMeditate on these: Eph. 3:12, Rom. 8:16-17"

He said, \"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven...\" (2 Chron. 7:14).\n\nHumility in the context of prayer simply means accepting your helplessness before God. What makes great men is God's grace, outside of God man is weak, helpless, despondent and frustrated. So, humility is acknowledging your total dependence on God. And the Bible says, \"He giveth grace to the humble, but He resists the proud\" (1Peter 5:5). So, when you approach prayer with a humble heart, you connect with grace.\n\nJesus told a parable of two men who went to the temple to pray. The first man proudly declared his spiritual CV before God -- \"I fast twice every week, I pay my tithes, I don't cheat, etc...\" But the other man dared not lift up his eyes. He bowed his head, put his hand on his chest and said, \"Lord, have mercy on me, I am a sinner. I am not worthy to come into your presence but because you have given me the privilege to come that's why I am speaking.\" And Jesus said, \"...This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted\" (Luke 18:14). Justification in prayer is a function of humility of heart.\n\nThank God for man's ability to pray but he can't answer prayer, only God has the power to answer prayers. This is why we must be humble before Him. We can call, we can even speak all the tongues of angels but we can't answer prayer and the joy of praying is the answers that follow. Minus answer, prayer is a futile and frustrating exercise. So, we are not praying because we have the ability to pray, we are praying because God is answering us.\n\nThere is a popular Christian song that says, \"Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me. And now, thou bidst me come to thee. Oh Lord, I come, I come.\" We must understand that we are not qualified to be the ones praying yet God has given us the privilege to draw near. And even in that privilege we have failed Him several times. We need His help and His mercy. When you approach God with that attitude and understanding, you enjoy the ceaseless flow of His grace.\n\nYou need humility of heart because God responds to it all the time. Jesus said \"I am meek and lowly in heart, I can of myself do nothing, as I hear so I speak\" (Matt. 11:28, Jn. 5:30). That is the language of a humble man. Humility of heart will always give you direct access to God's presence.\n\nMeditate on these: Ps. 10:17, James 4:10"

What God watches to determine your answer in prayer is not your utterance per say but the composure and attitude of your heart. And one of the requirements for you to enjoy good heart connection every time you approach God in prayer is fervency.\n\nFervency is the fire of prayer. Cold prayers don't go anywhere. The Bible says, \"Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain...\" (James 5:17-18). Elijah had feelings and emotions like you and I, but something made the difference, he was fervent. That is to let you know that despite the natural limitations and weaknesses, you can still be fervent in prayer and get the kind of results that Elijah got.\n\nFervency was the secret of answers to payer in Elijah's ministry. One day, the son of the widow of Zeraphath who fed him with her last meal died and the Bible says, \"...He stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD,and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived\" (1 Kings 17:21-22). You don't pray that kind of prayer casually; it must come from a fervent heart.\n\nFervency can be described as white hot fire. From studies on heat, it has been discovered that different degrees of fire give different colours of flame. The most elementary is red flame; that's the beginning or first stage of fire. Next to that is blue flame, but the highest degree of fire gives white flame that is the peak. And it is most often used for industrial purposes, especially for melting and mixing metals.\n\nSpiritually speaking, fervency in prayer is like heat at it's peak. It is the melting point where the heart of man becomes one with God's heart, where the glory and life of God flows into a man till he is changed, transfigured and transformed in His presence. It is also the peak of relationship between God and man. At that point communicating with God is like talking with a friend; \"face to face and mouth to mouth\" (Numbers 12:8). That is the stage where prayer is never turned back. Your prayers will no longer be turned back!\n\nIt takes fervency to prevail in prayers. And of course no man avails until he has prevailed. So, to avail in prayers you must develop your heart to a point of fervency in order to command heaven's attention and deliver results on the earth.\n\nMeditate on these: James 5:16, Luke 22:41, 44"

    "title": "God Will Answer Your Prayer!",
    "body": "Your understanding determines your benefits in life. The reason many are weary in prayer is because they lack understanding of what happens in prayer or what to expect when they pray. Understanding is what sustains interest and excitement in prayer. It instills faith in the heart and you know with faith nothing is impossible. One thing that will enhance your participation and results in prayer is the understanding that God is committed to answering your prayers.\n\nWe know God hears us when we pray according to His will (1 John 5:14). But, it is one thing for somebody to hear you and another thing for him to answer or grant your request. Many Christians lack assurance in this aspect. But Jesus said, \"Ask, and it shall be given you...\" (Matthew 7:7). Not \"It may be given you\" but \"it shall be given.\" And in verse 8 He said, \"For every one that asketh receiveth...\"So, answer to prayer is not reserved for a selected few, God will answer all that care to call. He is that committed.\n\nNobody gives his telephone number to somebody he doesn't want disturbance from. So the reason God said you should call upon Him is because He is ready to hear you and give you your heart's desires. And Ephesians 3:20 assures us that when God answers He does beyond what we can ask or think. There is no request you will ever make that can threaten or intimidate God. He is more than able to meet your need, because in Him consist the fullness of all things. Ever before you make your request, He has an answer ready. For \"...Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him\" (Matt 6:8).\n\nAnd why will God answers your prayer? Hebrews 4:15 says, \"...We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\"\"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\" During His earthly life, Jesus was attacked, opposed, and tempted as we are today. So He feels for us and identifies with our pains when we face challenges in life. God is compassionate towards you, and it is on this basis that verse 16 of Hebrews chapter 4 says,\n\nGod wants you to approach the throne of grace with the understanding that you are not alone in that battle, you have a God who cares about you and will not leave you to suffer. That is the mentality that will make you a full partaker of the grace you require for your help in the time of need.\n\nGod brought the Israelites out of bondage in response to their prayer because He saw their afflictions and was moved with compassion towards them (Exodus 3:7-8). I see that compassion flowing towards you today.\n\nMeditate on these: Matt. 7:11, Psalm 50:15"

    "title": "Connecting Power In Prayer!",
    "body": "One of the foremost products of prayer is power. Prayer connects us to the power of God. When we are in prayer we are in power.\nPower is the ability to do work or function in a certain capacity. That is having the authority to enforce law or be in control. Revelations 1:6 says that we have been made kings and priests unto God by Christ Jesus. But it takes power to reign in that capacity, it takes supernatural power to function as heaven's ambassadors on earth and to exercise divine authority.\n\nNothing works without power. But how do we gain access to this power? Jesus told His disciples in Acts 1:8, \"But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you...\" And in Acts chapter 2, on the day of Pentecost, they were with one accord in one place, that means they were in prayer. And suddenly the Holy Ghost came down and they were all filled. So, power came upon them as they were in prayer.\n\nAlso in Acts 4: 31,33, \"When they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the Word of God with boldness...And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.\" They went into the prayer room empty, but they returned filled with power.\n\nIn Luke 4:14, after Jesus had fasted and prayed for forty days, He returned in the power of the Spirit. We have another example in Genesis 32: 24-28. When Jacob was left alone, he wrestled with an angel till the breaking of the day. 'Wrestle' is another word for prayer. So, Jacob prayed all night and at the breaking of the day he said to the angel, \"I will not let you go, except you bless me.\" And the angel said, \"Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.\" So Prayer exercise is power processing. You never return the same way you go into the prayer room. The acid test for effective successful prayer is that there must be an infilling of the Holy Spirit and when that happens, power is guaranteed.\n\nWhat happens when power comes? \"...They spake the Word of God with boldness.\" Often, we go into the prayer room as weaklings, but when we have truly prayed, power is released and the proof that power is present is that it shows in our language. Instead of a beggarly, weak language, we return with a language of assurance, faith, and authority, because our tongues have been touched with coals of fire.\n\nThe reason they didn't lack God's power in the first church is because they stayed with God in prayer. No man stays with God and still lacks power. May you always return in His power, every time you go into prayer.\n\nMeditate on these: Ephesians 6:12, Ephesians 1:15-20"

    "body": "I believe one of the reasons God made day and night is not only for demarcation but also for the purpose of renewal, because at the end of each day, we rest, get refreshed and renewed to continue the race. So, there is a continuous process of renewal on a daily basis. Almost everything in life is made to require renewal from time to time. Whatever you use without renewal will soon get exhausted or extinguished, and this applies to our spiritual lives.\n\nOften times we talk of 'prevailing prayer'. The word, 'prevail' actually means to gain strength. So, when we talk about 'prevailing prayer', it means praying to renew or gain strength in order to have the upper hand in a tussle.\n\nGod is the giver of strength, as a matter of fact the Bible says He is our strength, but it is through prayer that we encounter this strength. Isaiah 40:28-29 says, \"...The everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary...He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.\"\n\nSo, prayer is a spiritual adventure that connects you to the almighty God, and your weakness is exchanged for His strength. It is a spiritual measure that enables you to climb higher or above your challenges and oppositions. That means, you overcome or 'come over' whatever it is that has been putting you down. Prayer is a form of spiritual wrestling, and as we wrestle, we receive strength to prevail. Somebody rightly said, \"When you kneel before God you grow taller before men.\"\n\nIn Acts chapter 2, as the disciples were in prayer, the Holy Ghost came down and they were filled with power. But in Acts chapter 4 they prayed and the place where they prayed shook, they were filled with the Holy Ghost again and great grace was upon them all. That means they gained more strength and in that strength, they went forth and preached the Word with boldness despising the threatening of the elders.\n\nOppositions will remain until you gain more strength to overcome them. So, don't run your life dry! Don't run your life empty till you become spiritually exhausted! Go for renewal! And the best ways to renew or build up spiritual strength is by praying in the Holy Ghost. Jude 20 says, \"But ye beloved, building up yourself on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost.\" No matter how low you have dropped, you can renew your strength in God. Note that it says, \"Building up yourself...!\" Strength renewal is a continuous process. Greater heights await you, so you have to keep building up every day to get there. When you pray in the Holy Ghost strength is guaranteed. You will not suffer weakness again!\n\nMeditate on these: 1 Chronicles 16:11, Ps. 18:39"

    "title": "You Can Be Free From Captivity!",
    "body": "One major benefit of prayer is captivity turning. The righteous is always Satan's target and he has just one objective for doing that; he wants to frustrate the believer and wear him out. He wants him to stop believing God, and to curse God so that he can be drawn out of the safety of divine covering to the open where he will be made an easy prey for satanic forces to deal with. But Psalm 34:19 says, \"Many are the afflictions of the righteous but God delivereth him out of them all.\" Not out of 'some', but out of them all. That means, all afflictions are resistible and destructible. There is an answer to every kind of oppression and a way out of all captivities.\n\nGod said in Jeremiah 29:12,14, \"Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you... and I will turn away your captivity...\" God is ever ready to turn away our captivities, but only on one condition - when we call upon Him and pray unto Him.\n\nIn Acts chapter 12, we are told that Herod had killed James the brother of John and because there was no reaction from the Church, he proceeded further to take Peter. He put Peter in prison, intending to bring him out to be killed after the Easter celebrations. But the Bible says, \"...Prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him...\"\n\nPeter was in captivity and would have been killed. He was put in prison, bound with two chains, kept between two soldiers and there were keepers outside the prison doors. Maybe you are in a similar situation, it looks as if you have been chained on every side. But we also see in that chapter that as the saints kept praying for Peter, the night before he was to be killed, the following happened: (1) The angel of the Lord came down, (2) a light shined in the prison, (3) the angel smote Peter on the side and raised him up, (4) Peter's chains fell off from his hands (5) the iron gate that led into the city opened to them of it's own accord (Acts 12:4-12).\n\nUntil the oppressed prays he cannot be free from oppression. But when you pray God will send His angel for your deliverance, the light of heaven will shatter every darkness around you, your chains will fall off and new doors of opportunity will begin to open to you on their own accord so that you can enjoy total restoration of all that you may have lost. In the model prayer that Jesus taught His disciples, one of the recommended prayer points is, \"...Deliver us from evil\" (Luke 11:2,4). Prayer is the gateway to freedom from oppressions and turning of captivities. That is biblical prescription. \"Is any among you afflicted? let him pray\"(James 5:13)\n\nMeditate on these: Psalm 50:15, Psalm 34:17"

    "body": "There is a mystery in prayer and it is the mystery of being able to connect with a higher source of power to overcome the circumstances of life. Prayer is our link to the invisible force of Heaven, to the Almighty God, who is stronger than the situations confronting us. The Bible says, \"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need\" (Hebrews 4:16).\n\nPrayer is meant for those who need help. It is calling on God for help based on the provisions He has made for us in His Word. Prayer is therefore an escape route from turbulence. If there were no need for help, God would not have created the avenue of prayer. David was a man who enjoyed God's help in all his battles and trials. You know how he got such help? He said, \"I cried unto the Lord and he heard me out of His holy hill ... He delivered me out of the hands of my enemies that were too strong for me\" (Psalm 3:4, 18:7).\n\nWhen we feel miserable and helpless, when we have tried all we can and there still seems to be no way out, we can get connect to a higher source of help through the power of prayer. It is in prayer that we exchange our weaknesses for God's strength. Somebody said, \"Our difficulties drive us into prayer and ultimately prayer drives our difficulties from us.\" Our difficulties move us to God and then God through our prayer drives the difficulties away from us.\n\nWhen we run into God's presence for help we exchanged our pressures for the pleasures that abound in God's presence. That is the secret of living a stress free life even in the midst of turbulence, till people begin to wonder if you ever have problems.\nThe Holy Spirit is our Helper and it is in prayer that we receive His help. \"Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.\" (Romans 8:26). The word 'infirmities' means weaknesses, so He helps our weaknesses. He also helps us in prayer.\n\nPrayer is like a relay race where the best and fastest runners take the last leg. In the same way, when we start the journey and begin to get weary and tired along the way, we pass the baton to the Holy Spirit to finish off the race for us. Or in a wrestling match, when your opponent is almost winning, you hand over to your partner; a stronger and better fighter who takes over from you and overcomes the opponent for you. So, when we pray, we compel heaven to open, to bear with us in our weaknesses, in order to be able to overcome the challenges of life. I see you receiving God's help today!\n\nMeditate on these: 2 Corinthian 3:5, Psalm 127:1"

He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart...He shall receive the blessing from the LORD...\" (Psalms 24:3-5).\n\nAs we walk with and render our services to the Lord, we must bear in mind that not every service or sacrifice is acceptable to Him, it must be from a pure heart to be acceptable before God. There is no end to how much contact a man of purity will make with God. Any day, any time, purity guarantees access to God's throne.\n\nAnd how does purity come? The Bible says, \"...Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\" (2 Tim 2:19). It is a personal responsibility; you don't wish to walk in purity, you accept responsibility to make it a reality in your life. We have a responsibility as Christians to depart from iniquity because God has given us the power of choice. He said, \"...I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live\" (Deut 30:19). When you genuinely make a choice to depart from iniquity, satan becomes powerless, he can not hold you down any more.\n\n2 Timothy 2:21 says, \"If a man...purge himself...he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use...\" You don't pray to be used of God, you prepare for it by purging yourself from iniquity; by fighting all evil thoughts on your inside - bitterness, envy, anger, evil speaking, etc. The more you're purged the more you're used by God, but the more impure you are the more He departs from you.\n\nChristianity demands purity; purity of language, purity of hands etc. Fight covetousness, don't take what is not yours, wait for God's lifting! Be faithful in all your dealings, just as Joseph was faithful. Free yourself from the contamination in the world. Remember, the devil is looking for the precious ones to catch, refuse to be trapped!\n\nOne major thing that will keep you from the temptations of the present is future mindedness; see a future ahead of you. It is the future you see that determines your discipline today. There is nothing satan is tempting you with today that will not become yours in a short while, God will give it to you in a more dignified way, so don't let the devil push you out of your destiny.\n\nGod has a bright future for you, but you need purity to get there. And you don't wait for purity, you accept responsibility for it. Be blessed today.\n\nMeditate on these: James 4:8, Zechariah 8:16-17"

The enemy is fighting very hard every day to get believers entangled in all manner of evil - immorality, covetousness, hatred, bitterness, lying, etc, all in a bid to make them unworthy of the glory that God has prepared for the end-time Church. Satan is launching great attacks on individuals through diverse means, without respect for position or title.\n\nOur world today advances so many legitimate reasons for people to commit evil without any feelings of remorse, but 1Peter 2:19 says, \"...Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priest hood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should shew forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness in to His marvelous light.\"\n\nIf you must escape the corruption that is in the world, then you must be able to identify where you belong. You are a peculiar people, so you can't afford to behave otherwise. You're of a royal class, if you are still meddling with sin you will lose your royalty.\n\n\"That ye should shew forth....\" We are called to show forth a quite and holy life, a controlled character full of love, meekness and humility. That means you don't need to announce to people that you're a Christian, they should see Christianity all over you just as you naturally see royalty on a king when he appears. We are told that the apostle's were first called Christians in Antioch because of their Christ like character, in the same way your character should speak for you. Let your Christianity be admired; let your character be such that can be emulated by others.\n\nThe reason we keep respecting God is because He keeps forgiving us; He keeps loving us. So, forgiveness should be your identity as a peculiar person.\n\nYou can never be fulfilled as a believer until you understand the purpose of our calling. The Bible says, \"...Ye are a chosen generation...\" For what purpose? Why did God choose you? Among other things He chose you to be a \"holy nation.\" God is holy, so He chose us to represent Him on earth by walking in holiness. This is why you must shun carnality and careless living. Keep thinking of how to represent Christ well. Before you act on any issue always ask yourself, \"If Christ were in this situation what would He do? How would He react?\" and act likewise.\n\nMeditate on these: 1 Peter 1:15, Genesis 17:1"

    "body": "Don't be deceived, victory over sin is possible! The devil is working very hard to confuse Christians and make them believe that dominion over sin is impossible but Jesus said, \"All things are possible to him that believes.\" The foundation of all possibility is your faith. When Satan succeeds in making you doubt on any issue, no matter how hard you pray, you hardly have a breakthrough in that area. But when you believe a thing can be done, it becomes a cheap possibility for you. The reason you are living in health is because you believe it is possible. If you can also believe, you will discover how cheap it is to live in this wicked world without a dent on your integrity. It is possible to live your life free from every snare of the enemy. Our fathers in the faith have proved it.\n\nIn the days of Noah, the world was so corrupt. The Bible says, \"And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth...And it repented the LORD that he had made man...\" (Gen 6:5-6). Yet concerning Noah it says, \"Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God\" (Gen 6:9). He was the only righteous man in his days. We have the same testimony concerning Enoch. \"And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him\" (Gen 5:24).\n\nWhat you believe is what you become, because what you believe is what you behave. Every man's behaviour is tied to what he believes. You know how Satan got Adam and Eve to sin in the beginning? He succeeded in making them doubt the word of God. He came to the woman and said, \"...Hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\" Satan often begins his temptation with questions, he questions you over what God has said until you begin to make considerations in your heart and look for reasons why you should not obey God.\n\nTemptation is Satan's attempt to make you shift your focus from God's Word, it goes beyond committing sin. Sin is only the end product of your doubting God's word, it is not satan's primary aim for tempting you. When Eve said, \"But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.\" Satan said to her, \"...Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil\" (Gen 3:3-5). And he continued till he convinced her that the fruit was very good for health, to make one wise, etc. Then she took it and also gave to her husband and they ate.\n\nSo until Satan makes you doubt the word he cannot make you sin. He wants you to doubt the possibility of having victory over sin but you can be from that deception today. If God has said, be ye holy, then it is possible to be holy.\n\nMeditate on these: Mark 9:23, John 1:12."

Note that it says, \"Sin shall not...\" not \"Sin may not...\" If you can understand this scripture, all your struggles with sin will be settled because; you don't struggle with what you have dominion over.\n\nThe reason God says, sin shall not have dominion over you, is because the power of sin has been broken. When Jesus died on the cross, He broke the backbone of satan, who is the author of sin, and made it possible for man to live above sin. He bore your sins and was bruised for your iniquity so that you will not live in sin again. Jesus knew no sin but He was made to be sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21).\n\nYou need to understand that when God speaks to us in His word He doesn't tell us what we are presently, rather He shows to us what we are expected to be or what we can become by virtue of what has been done on our behalf. So, because the sin issue has been settled through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, God's judgment or verdict is that it shall no longer have dominion over you. No matter what your story has been till now, sin shall not have dominion over you!\n\n1 Corinthians 6: 9-11 says, \"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you...\" Take note of the word 'were'. In continuation it says, \"...but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.\" This is a description of who you were before New Birth and who you are now - after New Birth. You were once among the unrighteous, living under the power of sin but now you are washed, sanctified and justified. That means whatever happens to you after you are born again is only temptation; it is only a trial by the enemy to see whether you know where belong or not. You are no longer under the power of sin.\n\nWe were once dead in sin but Colossians 2:13-15 makes us understand that through His death Jesus has forgiven all our trespasses and quickened us together with Himself. Not only that, He blotted out the handwriting of requirements that was against us by nailing it to His cross. He spoiled principalities and powers, He conquered satan and all his forces and made a public show of them. Praise God! That is the basis for Romans 6:14 -- Sin; and that means everything that represents evil -- envy, anger, covetousness, lying, etc shall not have dominion over you!\n\nMeditate on these: Ephesians 2:1-20"

Romans 6:11 says, \"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" The word 'reckon' means 'consider.' So, to exercise dominion over sin, consider yourself to be dead to it.\n\nEvery Christian is a 'dead man'! We died with Christ on the cross and we identified with His death through baptism. So, the Bible says you should consider yourself as dead unto sin but alive unto God. What is it about the dead? The dead does not know anything, the dead does not move, nothing appeals to a dead man. So, when it says, \"Consider yourself dead unto sin,\" it means don't let it appeal to you any more. Romans 6:7 says, \"For he that is dead is freed from sin.\" Whenever you are faced with temptation, do as a dead man would do; refuse to be moved. In case you still don't know what it means to be dead to sin, verse 13 says, \"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God...\" No matter how much you tempt a dead man with immorality for instance, he can't yield or give in to it. He can't participate with any part of his body, because he is dead.\n\nSome people make baseless excuses that the reason they fell into immorality is because they saw a woman who was half naked. No, it is because they are not yet dead to sin. The problem is not how somebody dressed, the problem is the way you are looking!\n\nMaybe you were once a heavy smoker; you were not only smoking you were a burner; everywhere you went smoke followed you, but now after New Birth, the smell of cigarette irritates you. Why? Because you are dead to it. It no longer appeals to you, you are free from it. There is no one as free as a 'dead man.' When you become dead to sin, then you are free indeed.\n\n\"Consider yourself to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God.\" That is to say, only the things of God should appeal to you; excite, move or get your attention. Life abhors vacuum, you are either dead to sin and alive to God or alive to sin and dead to God. As a matter of fact, it is your aliveness to the things of God that enhances your deadness to sin. The more you become alive to the things of God, the more you die to sin.\n\nLastly, \"Consider yourself as dead...\" means to see and treat yourself as 'dead' when it comes to the issue of sin. You have to change your mentality; see yourself the way God sees you, yield your members only to righteousness and you will never go down.\n\nMeditate on these: Romans 6:1-4, 18"

    "body": "Christianity is a continuous exercise; it's a race that must be continued. When they say somebody back slid it simply means he slid backwards. And what does it mean to slide back? It means to stop the race, he refused to continue. You know why you must continue the race of Christianity? From the day you left the camp of the devil he has not stopped pursuing you, he is waiting for the day you would stop or slide back so that he can overtake and get you entangled in sin. That is why the Bible talks about people who are overtaken in a fault (Galatians 1:6). And the reason they are overtaken is because they stopped. Christianity gives no room for stoppage, it does not allow room for passiveness, it is a race that you must continue!\n\nHow do you continue the race? Stand firm in the reality of what God has done for you. Romans 6:12 says, \"Let not sin...\" You have to make a decision; put up a resistance against sin. \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body...\" It will attempt to reign in your body but you must refuse.\n\n\"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\" We must not overlook the fact that after New Birth, our bodies still have the tendency to be tempted. No matter how anointed you are, your feelings and emotions are still alive, the tendency to be tempted is still very much there. But the Bible says, \"Let not.\" That was what informed Joseph's stand against the enticements from Portipha's wife; he refused (Gen. 39:6-8). That was also what informed Daniel's stand when he purposed not to defile himself with the kings' meat (Dan. 1:8). That was what informed Jesus' resistance against satan when He was tempted in the wilderness (Matt. 4:1-11).\n\n\"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body...\" Your mortal body will want to give in to sin because God does not kill your emotions after New Birth. We all still have emotions, that is why there is no man who is not tempted. Jesus Christ, the Son of God as anointed as He is, was tempted in all points, yet He sinned not (Heb. 4:15). God does not kill our emotions after New Birth, but He expects us to renew and school our emotions. He expects us to incline our emotions towards spiritual things. So, if you use to have passion for bitterness, you should now have passion for love and compassion.\n\nHowever, to make all of this possible, you must give yourself to the Word of God. Feed yourself with knowledge, refuse to yield your members; your eyes, your mind, your lips, etc to sin. Proverbs 1:10 says, \"My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.\" Don't submit your body to sin, don't give in. And, \"...If ye do these things, ye shall never fall...\" (2 Peter 1:10).\n\nMeditate on these: Job 28:28, Eccl. 12:13"
